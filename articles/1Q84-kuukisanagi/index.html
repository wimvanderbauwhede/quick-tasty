				<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/articles/learning-japanese/">previous posts</a>, I have been reading Haruki Murakami’s 1Q84 in Japanese (very slowly). After reading some reviews I wrote <a href="https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/articles/repetition-in-1Q84">a blog post</a> on why some of the characters frequently repeat one another, something critics didn’t like. Another thing several critics didn’t like is the Little People saying “Ho ho”.</p>

<p>So let’s have a look at this “Ho ho”. But first, in case you didn’t read the book, a quick setting of the scene may help.</p>

<h2 id="air-chrysalys">Air Chrysalys</h2>

<p>In 1Q84, there is a “book in the book” called “Air Chrysalys” (<em>kuukisanagi</em>, 空気さなぎ). This book is a kind of fairytale told from the perspective of a ten-year-old girl who lives in a rural commune. As punishment for letting an old mountain goat die, she gets locked up in a shed with the dead goat for a period of ten days<sup>*</sup>.</p>

<p>One night, the “Little People”<sup>**</sup> appear from the mouth of the dead goat. This scene starts with one of my favourite descriptions in the Japanese text:</p>

<p>あたりが暗くなると、死んだ山羊の目が星明かりを受けてきらりと光った。<br />
<em>atari ga kuraku naru to, shinda yagi no me ga hoshiakari wo ukete kirari to hikatta.</em><br /></p>

<p>In the English translation by Jay Rubin, this reads:</p>

<p><em>When darkness falls, the dead goat’s eye sparkles in the starlight.</em></p>

<p>The Japanese sentence sparkles a bit more because <em>kirari to</em> means “with a momentary flash of light” and <em>hikatta</em> means shine or glitter.</p>

<p>Murakami puts the reader nicely on the wrong foot, because when six small figures emerge from the goat’s mouth, the little girl thinks “This is like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but there is one missing”. The “Little People” read her thoughts and when she counts again there are seven of them.</p>

<p>Together with the girl they start to make an “air chrysalys” by pulling white threads out of thin air and weaving a kind of cocoon from them. While doing so, they talk to the girl.</p>

<h2 id="ho-ho-says-the-keeper-of-the-beat">“Ho ho,” says the keeper of the beat</h2>

<p>The Little People don’t have names or personalities and indeed it is impossible to keep them apart or even describe them in detail, but they have distinct voices. Usually, each of them speaks a short sentence in turn.
There is a recurrent pattern where one of them, in translation called the “keeper of the beat”, says “Ho ho”, and the others chorus “Ho ho”:</p>

<p>｢ほうほう｣はやし役のリトル・ピープルがはやした <br />
｢ほうほう｣残りの六人が声を合わせた <br /></p>

<p><em>“houhou” hayashiyaku no RITORU PIIPURU ga hayashita</em><br />
<em>“houhou” nokori no rokunin ga koe wo awaseta</em><br /></p>

<p>In the Japanese text, the “keeper of the beat” is called <em>hayashiyaku</em> (はやし役) and calls out <em>houhou</em> (ほうほう). This matters because if this “Ho ho” was merely an interjection or exclamation, it would likely be written <em>hoohoo</em> (ほぉほぉ or ほおほお). So we can assume that <em>houhou</em> has a meaning.</p>

<p>Japanese has many homonyms and this is no exception. There are several possible ways to write <em>houhou</em>, in <em>hiragana</em> or <em>kanji</em> (Chinese characters), each with a different meaning. According to <a href="https://kotobank.jp/word/%E3%81%BB%E3%81%86%E3%81%BB%E3%81%86-628513#E7.B2.BE.E9.81.B8.E7.89.88.20.E6.97.A5.E6.9C.AC.E5.9B.BD.E8.AA.9E.E5.A4.A7.E8.BE.9E.E5.85.B8">Kotobank</a>, <em>houhou</em> (ほうほう) means</p>

<p>① 物を投げたりたたいたりする音、またはそのさまを表わす語。ぽんぽん。<br /></p>

<p>“The sound of repeatedly throwing or striking something, or a word to representing it”</p>

<p>One of the kanji writings of <em>houhou</em> (ほうほう) is 彭々), which makes the meaning more clear because the character 彭 means “the sound of a drum”.</p>

<p>Because Murakami wrote the word in hiragana, we can’t be entirely sure, but the meanings of the other kanji writings (這々 perplexity, 方法 method) do not make much sense in the given context.</p>

<h2 id="the-link-with-noh-theatre">The link with Noh theatre</h2>

<p>One of the Little People, who Murakami calls the <em>hayashiyaku</em>, calls out “Ho ho”, and the other six echo this in chorus. The translator of the book, the great Jay Rubin, translates  <em>hayashiyaku</em> as “keeper of the beat” to reflect the meaning of <em>houhou</em> as drum beat, and also because Murakami uses the verb <em>hayasu</em> which literally means “to keep time”. So “says the keeper of the beat” is a very nice way to translate this.</p>

<p>But the literal meaning in Japanese is “member of a <em>hayashi</em>”, and <em>hayashi</em> (囃子) is <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%83%E5%AD%90">the four-piece orchestra</a> in the <a href="http://www.glopad.org/jparc/?q=en/node/22767">traditional Noh theatre</a>, consisting of three drummers and a flutist. The task of the drummers is to keep the rhythm (<em>hayasu</em>), but they also <a href="http://www.the-noh.com/en/world/music.html">use their voices to create drum calls</a>. Another component of Noh is the chorus, usually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noh#Chant_and_music"><em>six to eight</em> people</a>. And finally there are the actors, who unlike in traditional Western theatre do not ony speak their own lines, but can also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noh#Chant_and_music">‘describe events from the perspective of another character or even a disinterested narrator’</a>.</p>

<p>With this interpretation, Murakami allocates to his seven Little People the roles of actors, chorus and orchestra in a Noh performance, all at the same time, with an audience of one, the little girl. I think this is what lies behind the Little People saying “Ho ho”.</p>

<p><span class="footnotes">
 <br />
<sup>*</sup> In Japan, traditionally a month is split in three ten-day periods called <em>jun</em>(旬).<br />
<sup>**</sup> Murakami calls them リトル・ピープル (RITORU PIIPURU) which is <em>katakana</em> rendition of the English “Little People”. The little girl thinks of them as <em>kobito</em> (小人) which also means “little people”.

It is often said that Murakami avoids references to traditional Japanese culture, and instead focuses on contemporary Japanese culture. Maybe it is rather the case that his references to traditional Japanese culture are more oblique.
