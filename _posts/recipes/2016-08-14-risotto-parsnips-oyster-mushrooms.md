Risotto is a popular Italian-style one-pan dish, delicious and easy to make, and you can keep on creating variations. In this one I used parsnips and oyster mushrooms, a great combination. It works best with a proper risotto rice like Arborio. This recipe takes about 30 minutes to prepare.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients and groceries
  - two medium parsnips or one large one (about 300 g)
  - a pack of oyster mushrooms (150 g)
  - a teaspoon of finely chopped or grated ginger
  - 50 g grated hard Italian cheese (grana padano or parmezan, you can use another chees like Leerdammer if you want it less salty)

- From the store cupboard
  - a cup of risotto rice
  - a drizzle of _mirin_ (optional)
  - a handful of pine kernels
  - a teaspoon ground cumin
  - a teaspoon ground coriander
  - a teaspoon ground turmeric
  - two tablespoons soy sauce
  - one tablespoon olive oil for frying
  - a drizzle of garlic oil

#### Preparation

  - Wash, peel and dice the parsnips and put them in a microwave pot. Sprinkle on some _mirin_ and cook for 5 minutes at full power (900W).
  - Boil half a litre of water.
    - Meanwhile, wash the oyster mushrooms and cut them into chunks of about 1 cm wide.
    - Heat the oil and fry the mushrooms pine kernels, ginger and spices.
    - Add the rice, shake/stir to coat it with the spices and the oil.
  - Add some of the boiled water (just enough to cover the rice). Stir and simmer, covered, until the rice has absorbed the water.
  - Add the soy sauce and more boiled water, stir and simmer, covered, until the rice has absorbed the water.
  - You may have to add water a few more times, depending on how much you added at a time.
  - When the rice is getting quite creamy, add the parsnips.
  - Simmer for a few more minutes, then drizzle on some garlic oil and serve with the cheese.
