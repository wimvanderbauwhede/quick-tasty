 Orzo is durum wheat pasta shaped like grains of barley (called _orzo_ in Italian). In this recipe it is combined with celeriac and mixed mushrooms (oyster, shiitake, eryngii). The less common ingredient is [dried tofu (bean curd) sticks](https://shop.waiyeehong.com/food-ingredients/dried-products/dried-beancurd-seaweed/dried-beancurd-sticks-tofu-bamboo-2?language=tw). For the seasoning I also used _miso_ and [fermented broad bean paste (tobanjan)]({{ site.url }}/recipes/nabe-yellow-peppers-celeriac-shiitake-tofu/index.html).
