This original potato bake with carrots and courgettes is the winter version of the [Japanese potato salad]({{site.url}}/recipes/japanese-potato-salad/) and is great on a cold night. I use cream cheese to get a smooth consistency, and add grated cheese on top, which gives a nice crust when grilled. This bake makes a complete and very tasty meal.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients and groceries

  - 500 g potatoes
  - 2 medium carrots
  - a small courgette
  - 1 cm ginger
  - 3 tablespoons cream cheese (e.g. Philadelphia)
  - a cup of grated hard cheese for topping (I used Grana Padano)

- From the store cupboard  
  - salt and pepper

#### Preparation

  - Wash but don't peel the potatoes; wash the carrot and scrape or peel.
  - Cook the potatoes in the microwave for 5 minutes at full power (900W).
  - Add the carrot to the pot, cook in the microwave for another 5 minutes at full power (900W).
  - In the meantime, slice the courgette and the ginger very thinly.
  - Leave the potatoes and carrot to cool for a few minutes. 
  - Mix the potatoes, carrots, courgette, ginger and cream cheese in an oven dish. Mash coarsely with a fork until the consistency is smooth but still chuncky. Season to taste.
  - Sprinkle the grated cheese on top and grill for about 5 minutes, until the cheese has melted and there's a nice golden crust.
