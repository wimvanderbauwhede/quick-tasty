This is not a typically Japanese recipe but many of the ingredients are very common in Japanese cuisine. Butter and soy sauce is a great combination for frying potatoes, and the _umami_ of tomato puree blends really well with the aubergines.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients and groceries
  - about 400 g small or medium potatoes
  - 1 cm fresh ginger, sliced very thinly
  - 2 medium aubergines (about 200 g each)
  - 1 tablespoon butter (or olive oil) for frying
  - 1 tablespoon of tomato puree (preferably pure tomato, no added salt or sugar)
  - 200 g firm tofu
  - fresh coriander
	
- From the store cupboard
  - 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
  - 1 tablespoon soy sauce 	
  - 2 tablespoons tahini
  - 2 teaspoons miso
  - 1 teaspoon sugar

#### Preparation

- Wash and dice the potatoes. 
- Cook the potatoes in the microwave for about 4-5 minutes on full power (900W). 
- Stir and cook for another 4-5 minutes.
- Meanwhile, prepare the tofu-hummus. This is very similar to the Japanese shiraae (白和え), and very easy to make:
  - Put the block of tofu on a plate and dice it carefully so it keeps its original shape. Cover it with another plate and put some weight on it (e.g. some more plates) to squeeze out the excess water.
  - Put the tofu pieces in a bowl with the tahini, miso and sugar and scramble with a fork until the mixture is smooth but still a little chunky.
- Wash and slice the aubergines.
- Put the aubergine slices and the ginger in a pot and microwave for about 4 minutes on full power (900W). 
- Stir in the tomato puree and cook for another 4 minutes.
- Heat the butter or oil and stir-fry the potatoes with the sesame seeds for a minute. 
- Add the soy sauce and continue to stir-fry until the potatoes start to brown.
