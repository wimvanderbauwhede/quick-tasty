#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients:
  - about 200 g small tomatoes
  - two packs of mozzarella, or alternatively a pack of mini mozzarella balls
  - a serving of artichokes in oil or similar antipasti

- From the store cupboard  
  - a handful of walnuts
  - 200 g linguine or spaghetti

#### Preparation

- Cook the linguine (see <a href="{{ site.url }}/basics">basics#toc2</a> for how to cook pasta).
- While the pasta is cooking, cut tomatoes, mozzarella and artichokes in small bits. I usually serve each in a separate small bowl.
- When the pasta is ready, serve with the toppings and put some walnuts on top.
