#### Ingredients

For two people:

* Main ingredients:
    - 200 g soba noodles
    - 1 block of firm tofu 200-250 g
    - 300 g carrots
    - 1 medium courgette
    - a bundle of chives

    - 2 tablespoons sesame seeds
    - 1 teaspoon _miso_
    - 1 tablespoon soy sauce
    - 1 teaspoon sesame oil

#### Preparation

- Cook the soba noodles for 5 minutes in plenty of water. Wash carefully and drain.
- Meanwhile, cut the tofu into 1 cm slices and put it in the microwave for 3 minutes at full power (900W). When it has cooled, squeeze the moisture out of the pieces as much as possible.
- Meanwhile, cut the carrots and the courgette into _julienne_ strips and cook them in the microwave at full power (900W) for 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the cooking liquid into a small bowl.
- Meanwhile, heat the oil and fry the sesame seeds and ginger for a minute.
- Add the carrots, courgette and chives and fry over high heat for a minute or maybe two, depending on how fine you cut them.
- Add the tofu to the pan, crumble it with your hands or with a spatula.
- Fry for a few minutes over low heat, then lower the heat and let simmer.
- Meanwhile, mix the cooking liquid with the _miso_ and soy sauce.
- Add the mixture to the pan, add the cooked soba noodles and fry over medium heat until the liquid has completely gone.
