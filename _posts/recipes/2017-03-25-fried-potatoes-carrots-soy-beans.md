Time for a "Murakami meal": I had carrots and potatoes, and some soy beans in the freezer. I cooked everything in the microwave, then stir-fried the potatoes in butter and soy sauce.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

* Main ingredients:		

    - 500 g potatoes
    - 400 g carrots
    - 1 cup of frozen soy beans
    - 5 dried _shiitake_ mushrooms, soaked in hot water for at least an hour.

* Seasonings

    - fresh ginger: 1 tablespoon finely chopped, 1 cm thinly sliced
    - 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
    - 1 tablespoons _mirin_
    - 1 tablespoon soy sauce
    - 15 g butter or 1 tablespoon olive oil. Instead of pure butter I prefer a blend of butter and vegetable oil like Lurpak.

#### Preparation

- Put the  soy beans in the microwave for 2 minutes at full power (900W).
- Wash the potatoes and dice them into pieces small enough to eat with chopsticks.
- Cook the potatoes in the microwave at full power (900W) for 10 minutes, stir after 5 minutes.
- Cut the carrots into _julienne_ strips, add a tablespoon _mirin_ and cook them in the microwave at full power (900W) for 4 minutes.
- Cut the _shiitake_ mushrooms into small strips.
- Add the soy beans and _shiitake_ mushrooms to the carrots and microwave at full power (900W) for 2 minutes.
- Heat the butter and fry the sesame seeds and ginger for a minute.
- Add the potatoes and fry over high heat for a minute, add the soy sauce and fry for another minute.
