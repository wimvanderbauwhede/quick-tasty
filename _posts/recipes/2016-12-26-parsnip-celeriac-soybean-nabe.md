This is a Japanese-style recipe for a _nabe_ or hotpot, but with parsnips (パースニップ) and celeriac (セレリアック), two root vegetables that are less common in Japan.
You need several typically Japanese ingredients for this but I bought everything in the local supermarket except the _wakame_, which I bought in a local Chinese supermarket.

This reciped requires 30 minutes soaking time followed by 20 minutes cooking time.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

* Main ingredients:
  - about 200 g parsnips (1 large one)
  - about 200 g celeriac (half a bulb)
  - a cup of frozen soy beans
  - 1 cup of red rice (if you can't find it, brown rice is also fine)

* For seasoning I used:
  - 5 dried _shiitake_ mushrooms
  - a 2 cm piece of ginger, thinly sliced
  - 1 piece of _konbu_ (about 5x10cm)
  - 1 tablespoon _miso_
  - 2 teaspoons dried _wakame_
  - 2 teaspoons _mirin_ (sweet rice wine, optional)


#### Preparation

* Soaking: 30 minutes
    - Boil a cup of water and soak the _shiitake_ for 30 minutes.
    - Meanwhile,  put the rice and _konbu_ together in a pot with 2 cups of cold water and soak for 30 minutes.
    - Meanwhile, soak the _wakame_ for 15 minutes in a pot of cold water.
    - After soaking the _shiitake_, slice them thinly.

* Cooking: 20 minutes  
    - Cook the rice with the _konbu_ for 6 minutes, either on the hob or in the microwave at full power (900W).
    - Meanwhile, cook the beans for 3 minutes in the microwave at full power (900W).
    - Soak the _wakame_ in about half a liter of water. It will increase in volume by up to 6 times.
    - Wash and clean the parsnip and celeriac.
    - Cut the vegetables in pieces of about 2 by 3 cm and about 3 mm thick.
    - Slice the ginger as thin as you can.
    - Put the vegetables and ginger in a microwave pot and add the _mirin_. Cook for 6 minutes at full power (900 W).
    - Take the pot out of the microwave and pour about 100 ml of the cooking liquid into a bowl. Add a few tablespoons of the soaking liquid of the _shiitake_. Put the _miso_ into the bowl and mix until it is dissolved.
    - Drain the _wakame_ and add it to microwave pot.
    - Add the beans to the microwave pot.
    - Drain the _shiitake_, squeeze them gently to remove some of the liquid and slice them thinly. Add them to the microwave pot.
    - Pour the _miso_ mixture over the other ingredients and mix.
    - Cook for 2 minutes at full power (900 W).
- Serve with the rice and season to taste with _shichimi togarashi_ and golden sesame seeds.
