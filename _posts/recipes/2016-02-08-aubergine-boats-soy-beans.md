This is another ["Murakami meal"]({{ site.url }}/articles/murakami-meals). I had aubergines and I decided to fill them with a mixture of soy beans, seaweed, _shiitake_ mushrooms and _miso_,  and serve them with red rice cooked with _konbu_ seaweed. Although the ingredients are typically Japanese, filled aubergine is not a traditional Japanese recipe. But it's delicious!

#### Ingredients

For two people:

* Main ingredients:
    - a cup of frozen soy beans
    - 2 medium aubergines
    - 1 cup of red rice (if you can't find it, brown rice is also fine)

* For seasoning I used:
    - 5 dried _shiitake_ mushrooms
    - a 2 cm piece of ginger, thinly sliced
    - 1 piece of _konbu_ (about 5x10cm)
    - 1 tablespoon _miso_
    - 1 teaspoon dried _wakame_
    - 1 teaspoon _mirin_ (optional)

#### Preparation

* Soaking: 30 minutes
    - Boil a cup of water and soak the _shiitake_ for 30 minutes.
    - Meanwhile,  put the rice and _konbu_ together in a pot with 2 cups of cold water and soak for 30 minutes.
    - Meanwhile, soak the _wakame_ for 15 minutes in a pot of cold water.
    - After soaking the _shiitake_, slice them thinly.

* Cooking: 20 minutes  
    - Cook the rice with the _konbu_ for 6 minutes, either on the hob or in the microwave at full power (900W).
    - Meanwhile, cook the beans for 3 minutes in the microwave at full power (900W).
    - Scoop out the flesh from the aubergines and cook the shells for 5 minutes in the microwave at full power (900W). Chop the flesh coarsely.
    - Remove the _konbu_ from the pot with rice and slice it into smaller strips. Return half of it to the pot and continue cooking for another 20 minutes or until all the water has been absorbed.  
    - Heat the oil and fry the ginger and the other half of the _konbu_. Add the aubergine flesh and fry over medium heat until the aubergine has softened.
    - Add the soy beans, _shiitake_ and _wakame_ and cook for a few minutes on low heat.
    - Dissolve the _miso_ in a few tablespoons of soaking liquid from the _shiitake_, and pour it over the aubergines.
    - Let simmer for a few minutes over low heat.
    - Stuff the aubergine shells with the mixture and microwave for 1 minute at full power (900W).
    - Serve with the rice.
