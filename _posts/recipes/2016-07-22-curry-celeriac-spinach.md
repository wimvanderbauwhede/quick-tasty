Celeriac, spinach and mushrooms go together surprisingly well. Combined with fried paneer (Indian fresh cheese, available in most supermarkets) this makes a great mild curry.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients:
  - 500 g celeriac
  - a pack of chestnut mushrooms (ordinary mushrooms are fine too)
  - about 200 g spinach
  - 1 pack of paneer (about 200 g)
  - 1 cm fresh ginger

- From the store cupboard  
  - 1 cup basmati rice
  - spices: turmeric, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, cardamom pods, cayenne pepper to taste (I use about a teaspoon of each of the spices and just a pinch of the cayenne pepper)
  - seeds: sesame, sunflower, some pumpkin (I use about 1 tablespoon of each)
  - 1 tablespoon of soy sauce
  - oil for cooking (I use olive oil)
  - optional: garlic oil

#### Preparation

* Cook the rice (see <a href="{{ site.url }}/basics">basics</a> for how to cook rice).
* While the rice is cooking:
  - Wash and dice the celeriac. Cook it in the microwave at full power (900W) for 4 minutes, then stir, then cook for another 3 minutes.
  - Wash and slice the mushrooms.
  - If you're using whole seeds like I do, grind the coriander seeds, cumin seeds and cardamom pods.
  - Chop the ginger very fine.
  - Cut the paneer into cubes of about 1 cm on the side.
  - Heat the oil in a large deep pan. I recommend a non-stick pan with a lid.
  - When the oil is hot, add the ginger, seeds and spices and fry over medium heat for a minute.
  - Add the mushrooms and fry over medium to high heat for a few minutes, until the mushrooms start to release their moisture.
  - Add the paneer and stir until it is evenly covered with the seeds and spices.
  - Fry for a few minutes more over medium heat, then turn up the heat for 30 seconds or so.
  - Clear some space in the middle of the pan and put in the soy sauce. Stir vigorously, then lower the heat.
  - Cook the spinach in the microwave at full power (900W) for 1 minute.
  - Meanwhile, add the celeriac to the pan, stir until it is well covered with the spices.
  - Cut up the cooked spinach and add it to the pan. Stir and let simmer for a few more minutes.
  - Add garlic oil to taste.
* Serve with the rice.
