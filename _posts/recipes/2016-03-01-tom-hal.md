This is one of my favourite recipes, very easy to make, ready in 15 minutes and very tasty. You can also make this with courgettes instead of tomatoes.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients:
  - 4 large tomatoes
  - 200-250 g halloumi cheese (1 pack)

- From the store cupboard  
  - a handful of pumpkin seeds
  - 1 cup of basmati rice, slightly less than 2 cups of water

#### Preparation
- Cook the rice (see <a href="{{ site.url }}/basics">basics</a> for how to cook rice).
- While the rice is cooking:
	- Cut the tomatoes in half.
	- Take a shallow dish with a lid, large enough to so that you can put the tomato halves next to one another. I use a heat resistant glass dish.
	- Cut the halloumi in thin slices (2-3 mm) and cover the tomatoes with it.
	- Sprinkle the pumpkin seeds on top.
	- Put the lid on and put in the microwave for 5 minutes at full power (assuming a 900W microwave, Cat. E).
	- Let it sit for 1-2 minutes, then cook for another 2 minutes at full power.
- If you used basmati rice, it will be ready too, serve and enjoy!
