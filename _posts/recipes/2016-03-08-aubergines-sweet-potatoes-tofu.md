Aubergines are very popular in Japan and there are many different ways of cooking them. Japanese aubergines are much smaller than the ones you can buy here, so I pick the smallest I can find. You need several typically Japanese ingredients for this but I bought everything in the local supermarket except the wakame, which I bought in a local Chinese supermarket.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients & groceries
  - about 300 g sweet potatoes
  - 1 small aubergine (if you have real Japanese aubergines you'll need three of them)
  - half a packet of silken tofu (150 g)
  - 1 cm fresh ginger

- From the store cupboard  
  - 1 cup of Japanese rice
  - 1 tablespoon _miso_ paste
  - 2 tablespoon _mirin_
  - a tablespoon of dried _wakame_
  - _shichimi togarashi_ and golden sesame seeds for seasoning (optional)

#### Preparation

- Cook the rice (see <a href="{{ site.url }}/basics">basics</a> for how to cook Japanese rice).
- While the rice is cooking:
    - Soak the _wakame_ in about half a liter of water. It will increase in volume by up to 6 times.
    - Wash and clean the sweet potatoes and aubergines.
    - Cut the aubergines in round slices of about 3-5 mm thick.
    - Cut the sweet potatoes in pieces of about 2 by 3 cm and about 3 mm thick.
    - Slice the ginger as thin as you can.
    - Put the aubergines, sweet potatoes and ginger in a microwave pot and add the _mirin_. Cook for 8 minutes at full power (900 W).
    - After 10 minutes, take the pot out of the microwave and pour about 100 cl of the cooking liquid into a bowl. Put the _miso_ into the bowl and mix until it is dissolved.
    - Drain the _wakame_ and add it to microwave pot.
    - Cut the _tofu_ into small cubes (about 1 cm on the side) and add it to microwave pot.
    - Pour the miso mixture over it and mix the ingredients taking care not to mash the _tofu_ pieces.
    - Cook for 3 minutes at full power (900 W).
- Serve with the rice and season to taste with _shichimi togarashi_ and golden sesame seeds.
