This surprising combination is very easy to make and really tasty. Cranberries are very sour so I combine them with apples to sweeten them. The mushrooms make the dish hearty and the chickpeas add crunchiness.

For two people:

  - Peel & slice the apples and add them to the cranberries, cook in the microwave for 3 minutes at full power (900 W).
  - Wash, clean & slice the mushrooms.
  - Cook the mushrooms in the microwave for 3 minutes at full power (900 W).
