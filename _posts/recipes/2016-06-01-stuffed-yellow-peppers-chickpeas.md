#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients and groceries
  - 2 yellow or orange bell peppers
  - 2 medium tomatoes
  - 2 slices of brown bread
  - 2 tablespoons muesli
  - 1 teaspoon chopped ginger

- From the store cupboard
  - 1 teaspoon ground coriander
  - 2 tablespoon sunflower seeds
  - 2 tablespoon pumpkin seeds
  - 1 tin chickpeas
  - 1 cup basmati rice
  - 2 tablespoon olive oil
  - 2 teaspoon soy sauce
  - 1 teaspoon garlic oil 	

#### Preparation

- Cook the rice (see <a href="{{ site.url }}/basics">basics</a> for how to cook rice).
- While the rice is cooking:
  - Make the filling for the peppers: crumble the bread and mix it with the muesli, a tablespoon of olive oil, a teaspoon of soy sauce and the coriander.
  - Wash the peppers, cut off the top and remove the seeds from the inside.
  - Stuff the peppers with the filling.  	
  - Chop the tomatoes into small bits.
  - Put half of the chopped tomatoes on top of the filling, then put the top of the pepper back on.
  - Put in the microwave for 8-10 minutes on full power (900W).
- While the peppers are cooking:
  - Rinse the chickpeas and put them in a microwave pot with the other half of the chopped tomatoes, the ginger, the seeds, a teaspoon of soy sauce and a teaspoon of garlic oil.
- Cook the chickpeas in the microwave for 4 minutes on full power (900W).
