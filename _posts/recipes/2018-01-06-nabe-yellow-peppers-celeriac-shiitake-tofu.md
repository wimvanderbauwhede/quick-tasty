This is a Japanese-style recipe for a _nabe_ or hotpot, but with yellow peppers (黄色いピーマン), _shiitake_ and celeriac (セレリアック), a root vegetable that is less common in Japan.
You need several typically Japanese ingredients for this but I bought everything in the local supermarket except the _wakame_ and the black bean paste  which I bought in a local Chinese supermarket.

* Fermented broad bean paste (called _doubanjiang_ in Chinese or _tobanjan_ (豆板醤) in Japanese) is optional but gives a mild spicy taste to the nabe. Make sure to check the ingredients as there are many types of chilli bean paste and a lot of them are not vegetarian. The Chinese characters are 豆瓣酱. If it says 辛豆瓣酱 then it will be very spicy. The brand I got is [Pearl River Bridge Chilli Bean Paste](https://shop.waiyeehong.com/food-ingredients/sauces-oils/other-sauces/chilli-bean-paste-toban-paste).
* The _wakame_ seaweed is a traditional ingredient in many _nabe_ recipes. I bought a Korean brand, [A+ Hosan Dried Seaweed (Ito Wakame) (紫菜絲)](https://shop.waiyeehong.com/food-ingredients/dried-products/dried-beancurd-seaweed/dried-seaweed-ito-wakame).



This recipe requires 30-45 minutes resting and soaking time for the Japanese rice and 20 minutes cooking time.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

* Main ingredients:
  - 4 baby yellow peppers (or one large one)
  - half a celeriac (about 200 g)
  - 1 pack of _shiitake_ (200 g)
  - 1 block of firm tofu (200 g)
  - 1 cup of Japanese rice  

* For seasoning I used:
  - a 2 cm piece of ginger, thinly sliced
  - 1 tablespoon _miso_
  - half a teaspoon black bean paste (_tobanjan_)
  - 2 teaspoons dried _wakame_
  - 2 tablespoons _mirin_ (sweet rice wine, optional)

#### Preparation

- Cook the rice  (see <a href="{{ site.url }}/basics">basics</a> for how to cook rice).
- Soak the _wakame_ in about half a liter cold water.
- Wash and clean the _shiitake_, yellow peppers and celeriac.
- Cut the vegetables and tofu in pieces of about 2 by 3 cm and about 5 mm thick.
- Slice the ginger as thin as you can.
- Put the peppers and ginger in a microwave pot and add the _mirin_. Cook for 4 minutes at full power (900 W).
- Add the _shiitake_, _wakame_ and celeriac and cook for 6 minutes at full power (900 W).
- Drain the cooking liquid into a bowl and use it to dissolve the _miso_ and black bean paste.
- Add the tofu pieces to the microwave pot.
- Pour the _miso_ mixture over the other ingredients and mix.
- Cook for 3 minutes at full power (900 W).
- Serve with the rice and season to taste with _shichimi togarashi_ and golden sesame seeds.
