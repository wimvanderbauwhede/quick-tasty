This is one of my favourite recipes, very easy to make, super quick and very tasty.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients:
  - 2 medium courgettes (15-20 cm)
  - 200 g feta cheese (1 pack). I usually look out for feta with relatively low salt content, less than 2 g/100 g.

- From the store cupboard  
  - a handful of pine kernels
  - a drizzle of garlic oil
  - 1 cup of basmati rice

#### Preparation
- Cook the rice (see <a href="{{ site.url }}/basics">basics</a> for how to cook rice).
- While the rice is cooking:
	- Cut the courgettes in half.
	- Take a shallow dish with a lid, large enough to so that you can put the courgette halves next to one another. I use a heat resistant glass dish.
	- Cut the feta in thin slices (2-3 mm) and cover the courgettes with it.
	- Sprinkle the pine kernels on top and drizzle on a little garlic oil.
	- Put the lid on and put in the microwave for 5 minutes at full power (assuming a 900W microwave, Cat. E).
	- Let it sit for 1-2 minutes, then cook for another 5 minutes at full power. The feta will start to brown around the edges, this is normal and tastes great.
- If you used basmati rice, it will be ready too, serve and enjoy!
