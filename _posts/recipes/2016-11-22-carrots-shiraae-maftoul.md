Carrots are great when stir fried with some seeds and spices. I cook them in the microwave for a short time so the frying is quicker, and I add apples as a sweetener. The tofu-hummus is very similar to the Japanese _shiraae_, and very easy and quick to make. This goes really well with maftoul (giant couscous).

#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients and groceries
  - 400 g carrots
  - a small apple
  - 1 teaspoon chopped ginger
  - 200 g silken tofu

- From the store cupboard
  - 2 tablespoons tahini
  - 2 teaspoons miso
  - 1 teaspoon sugar
  - 1 cup maftoul
  - 1 teaspoon ground coriander
  - 1 teaspoon ground cumin
  - 1 tablespoon sunflower seeds
  - 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
  - 1 tablespoon soy sauce

#### Preparation

- Put the maftoul in a microwave pot with 1.5 cups of water and a teaspoon soy sauce and cook for 4 minutes at full power (900W).
- Peel the apple and slice quite thinly.
- Wash and dice the carrots. Cook them in the microwave, about 5 minutes on full power
(900W).
- When the carrots are done, stir the maftoul, then cook it for 4 more minutes on full power (900W).
- Meanwhile, heat the olive oil and fry the ginger, spices and seeds for a few minutes on medium heat.
- Add the carrots and stir-fry on high heat for a few minutes.
- Add the apple slices and stir-fry on high heat for a few minutes.
- Meanwhile, prepare the tofu-hummus:
  - Put the block of tofu on a plate and dice it carefully so it keeps its original shape. Cover it with another plate and put some weight on it (e.g. some more plates) to squeeze out the excess water.
  - Put the tofu pieces in a bowl with the tahini, miso and sugar and scramble with a fork or chops sticks until the mixture is smooth but still a little chunky.
