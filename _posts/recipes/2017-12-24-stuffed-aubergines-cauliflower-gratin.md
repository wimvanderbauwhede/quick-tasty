#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients:
  - 1 aubergine (about 200 g)
  - half a cauliflower (about 200 g)
  - 1 tomato (about 100 g)
  - 400 g potatoes
  - 1 cm ginger, finely chopped
  - juice of half a lemon
  - 100 g Philadelphia cheese
  - 4 tablespoons double cream
  - half a cup of grated hard cheese (I used a mix of half Grana Padano and half Jarlsberg)

- From the store cupboard  
    - a handful of porcini mushrooms, soaked in hot water for 30 minutes (keep the soaking liquid)
    - 1 teaspoon coriander seeds
    - 1 teaspoon cumin
    - 1 teaspoon allspice
    - 2 tablespoons pumpkin seeds, ground
    - 1 tablespoon pine kernels
    - 1 tablespoon soy sauce
    - 1 teaspoon sugar 
    - 1 tablespoon olive oil
    - 1 teaspoon garlic oil

#### Preparation

- Stuffed aubergines      
    - Cut the cauliflower into small florets and cook for 4 minutes in the microwave at full power  (900 W).
    - Cut the aubergine lengthwise into two and scoop out the flesh and set aside. Cook the shells for 4 minutes in the microwave at full power  (900 W).
    - If you want to save time, start cooking the potatoes for the gratin now. 
    - Chop the aubergine flesh.
    - Chop the tomato into very small pieces.
    - Heat the oil and fry the ginger, spices and ground pumpkin seeds for a few minutes. Add the pine kernels and cauliflower and stir-fry over high heat until the cauliflower starts to brown.
    - Add the soy sauce, tomato, aubergine flesh, sugar and lemon juice and stir-fry over medium heat until the tomato becomes soft and the aubergine flesh is done. Let it simmer for a few minutes more on low heat.
    - Stuff the aubergine shells with the mixture and cook for 2 minutes in the microwave at full power  (900 W).

- Potato gratin
    - Cook the potatoes for 10 minutes in the microwave at full power (900 W).
    - Cut the potatoes into thin slices and arrange them in an oven tray.
    - Mix the cream with the Philadelphia cheese and two tablespoons of the porcini mushroom soaking liquid and heat in the microwave for a minute at full power (900 W). Stir and check if it is liquid enough to pour, otherwise heat a bit longer. Add a teaspoon of garlic oil and the porcini mushrooms and pour the mixture over the potatoes.
    - Bake the pototoes for 2 minutes in the microwave at full power (900 W). 
    - Add the grated cheese on top and grill for 4 minutes.
