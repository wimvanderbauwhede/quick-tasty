This is a surprising combination of orzo (pasta shaped like grains of barley) with steamed broccoli and stir-fried paneer (fresh Indian cheese).

#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients and groceries
    - 350 g broccoli (2 medium heads)
    - 1 pack paneer (about 200 g)
    - small amount (1 cm) of grated ginger

- From the store cupboard
  - four dried tomatoes
  - 1 cup orzo
  - a handful of pine kernels
  - 1 teaspoon ground cumin 	
  - 1 teaspoon ground coriander
  - 1 tablespoon soy sauce
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil for frying
 	
#### Preparation

- Cook the orzo just like <a href="{{ site.url }}/basics/#toc2">regular pasta</a>.    
- Meanwhile:
  - Soak the dried tomatoes in boiled water for about 10 minutes, then chop up into pieces of about 0.5cm.
  - Wash the broccoli. Divide into florets and steam them. I cook them in the microwave for 5 minutes on full power (900W); I use a pot with a small insert, similar to a steamer basket, so that the cooking liquid can drain.
  - Stir-fry the paneer with the spices, ginger and pine kernels over medium to high heat, until the paneer starts to brown a little.
  - Add the soya sauce, then the broccoli and the soaked tomatoes, fry some more over low heat.
- Drain the orzo and add to the pan, drizzle on garlic oil and serve.
