A tortilla is a Spanish-style omelette with potatoes, very quick and easy to make. Adding mushrooms and pine kernels makes for a great combination. I usually serve this with a green side salad.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients and groceries
  - 4 medium eggs
  - 400 g medium potatoes
  - a pack of chestnut mushrooms (about 200g)
  - a cup of grated hard cheese (Grana Padano or parmezan)

- From the store cupboard
  - a handful of pine kernels
  - three dried tomatoes
  - a teaspoon ground cumin
  - a tablespoon of olive oil
  - a drizzle of garlic oil (optional)

#### Preparation

- Wash the potatoes. Cook them in the microwave, about 8-10 minutes on full power (900W). Stir after 5 minutes.
- While the potatoes are cooking:
    - Soak the dried tomatoes in a cup of boiled water for about 10 minutes.
    - Wash and slice the mushrooms.
    - Beat the eggs in a bowl until you have a smooth mixture.
- Dice the cooked potatoes.
- Stir-fry the mushrooms, cumin and pine kernels in olive oil until the mushrooms start to release their liquid.
- Add the potatoes and dried tomatoes and stir-fry for a few more minutes.
- Lower the heat to minimum setting and pour the egg mixture in the pan, moving the pan around so it distributes evenly.
- Let the tortilla simmer with the lid on until the egg has set.
- Drizzle on some garlic oil and sprinkle on the cheese.
