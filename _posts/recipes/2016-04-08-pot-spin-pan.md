This very tasty recipe takes about 30 minutes to prepare, it's a mild potato curry with a base of spices and seeds. The paneer (Indian fresh cheese, available in most supermarkets) is great when fried like this with sesame seeds and turmeric. I also make this recipe with chickpeas instead, and prepare it in quite the same way.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients:
  - about 400 g small potatoes
  - 2 large tomatoes
  - about 200 g spinach
  - 1 pack of paneer (about 200 g)
  - 1 cm fresh ginger

- From the store cupboard  
  - spices: turmeric, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, cardamom pods, cayenne pepper to taste (I use about a teaspoon of each of the spices and just a pinch of the cayenne pepper)
  - seeds: sesame, sunflower, some pumpkin (I use about 1 table spoon of each)
  - 1 table spoon of soy sauce
  - oil for cooking (I use olive oil)
  - optional: garlic oil

#### Preparation
- Wash the potatoes and cut them in two. Cook them in the microwave.
- Chop the tomatoes very fine.
- If you're using whole seeds like I do, grind the coriander seeds, cumin seeds and cardamom pods.
- Chop the ginger very fine.
- Cut the paneer into cubes of about 1 cm on the side.
- Heat the oil in a large deep pan. I recommend a non-stick pan with a lid.
- When the oil is hot, add the ginger, seeds and spices and fry over medium heat for a few minutes.
- Add the paneer and stir until it is evenly covered with the seeds and spices.
- Fry for a few minutes more over medium heat, then turn up the heat for 30 seconds or so.
- Clear some space in the middle of the pan and put in the soy sauce. Stir vigorously.
- Add the tomatoes and stir well. Lower the heat and leave to simmer for a few minutes until the tomatoes have softened. You can speed this up by first putting the chopped tomatoes in the microwave for 2 minutes.
- Cook the spinach in the microwave at full power (900W) for 1 minute.
- Meanwhile, add the potatoes to the pan, stir until the potatoes are no longer looking white.
- Cut up the spinach. Add the spinach to the pan, stir and let simmer for a few more minutes.
- Add garlic oil to taste.

This is really a complete one-pan meal but sometimes I serve it with rice too.
