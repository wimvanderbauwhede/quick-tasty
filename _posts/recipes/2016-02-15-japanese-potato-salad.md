Although potato salad may not sound very Japanese (maybe a bit more when you call it ポテトサラダ, "_potetosarada_"), it has long been very popular in Japan. There are some original Japanese recipes at [Just Hungry](http://justhungry.com/2006/05/japanese_potato.html) and [Just One Cookbook](http://www.justonecookbook.com/japanese-potato-salad/). My version is a little bit different: I prefer the potatoes unpeeled, I add some ginger and I use courgette instead of cucumber because I find that British cucumbers are too different from Japanese _kyuuri_. I serve this potato salad sometimes with rice, or with a side salad as in the picture.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients and groceries
  - 500 g potatoes
  - 1 medium carrot
  - half a courgette
  - 1 cm ginger
  - 1 egg (2 if you want more protein)
  - 3 tablespoons mayonnaise, preferably Japanese (I use Kewpie) or homemade

- From the store cupboard  
  - salt and pepper

#### Preparation

  - Wash but don't peel the potatoes; wash the carrot and scrape or peel.
  - Boil the egg(s) until hard-boiled (10 minutes).
  - At the same time, cook the potatoes in the microwave for 5 minutes at full power (900W).
  - Add the carrot to the pot, cook in the microwave for another 5 minutes at full power (900W).
  - In the meantime, slice the courgette and the ginger very thinly.
  - Peel the hard-boiled egg and chop up finely.
  - Leave the potatoes and carrot to cool until almost room temperature.
  - When the potatoes and carrot have cooled down, mix in the courgette, ginger and egg. Mix in the mayonnaise and mash coarsely with a fork.
