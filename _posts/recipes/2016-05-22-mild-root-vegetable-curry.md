This very tasty recipe takes about 30 minutes to prepare. It is a mild root vegetable curry with a base of spices and seeds. The paneer (Indian fresh cheese, available in most supermarkets) is great when fried like this with sunflower seeds and turmeric. I also make this recipe with chickpeas instead, and prepare it in quite the same way.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients and groceries
  - carrots, parsnips, potatoes and a small sweet potato (about 1/2 kg all together)
  - 2 small tomatoes
  - paneer (Indian fresh cheese) (1 pack)
  - fresh ginger (1 tablespoon chopped finely)

- From the store cupboard
  - 1 cup basmati rice
  - spices: ground cumin seeds (1 teaspoon), ground coriander seeds (1 teaspoon), ground turmeric (2 teaspoons), cayenne pepper or nanami togarashi (Japanese spice mix) (1 teaspoon)
  - seeds and nuts: sunflower seeds and/or sesame seeds (2 tablespoons), cashew nuts (1 cup)
  - soy sauce (1 tablespoon)
  - oil for cooking (I use olive oil) (1 tablespoon)
  - optional: garlic oil (1 teaspoon)


#### Preparation
* Cook the rice (see <a href="{{ site.url }}/basics">basics</a> for how to cook rice).
* While the rice is cooking:
  * Chop up the tomatoes and let them reduce (I do this in the microwave, 2 minutes at full power 900 W).
  * Peel and dice the vegetables, then either steam or microwave (6 minutes at full power 900 W).
  * Grind the cashew nuts (I use a pestle and mortar). The finer you grind them the creamier the curry will be.
  * Dice the paneer.
  * Heat the olive oil.
  * Add ginger, spices (except cayenne/nanami) and sunflower seeds, and fry over low heat for a few minutes, then add the paneer, fry for a few more minutes, stirring all the time.
  * Add the cayenne/nanami and stir for another minute.
  * Add the tomatoes, then the soy sauce and stir for another minute.
  * Then add the cashew nuts and stir for another minute.
  * Finally add the vegetables and the garlic oil and let it simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes or so.  
* Serve with the rice
