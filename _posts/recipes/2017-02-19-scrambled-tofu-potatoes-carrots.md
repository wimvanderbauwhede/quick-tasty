This is a variation on scrambled tofu _iridoufu_ (炒り豆腐). I combined it with potatoes and stir-fried carrots into a complete one-pan meal. It takes a bit longer because the carrots need to be cut quite finely.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

* Main ingredients:		

    - 1 block of firm tofu 200-250 g
    - 400 g potatoes
    - 300 g carrots
    - 5 dried _shiitake_ mushrooms, soaked in hot water for at least an hour. You will need 4 tablespoons of the soaking liquid as well.

* Seasonings

    - 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh ginger
    - 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
    - 1 tablespoon pumpkin seeds
    - 2 tablespoons _miso_
    - 1 tablespoon soy sauce
    - 1 teaspoon sesame oil
    - 1 tablespoon olive oil

#### Preparation

- Cut the tofu into pieces and put it in the microwave for 3 minutes at full power (900W). When it has cooled, squeeze the moisture out of the pieces as much as possible.
- Wash the potatoes and dice them into pieces small enough to eat with chopsticks.
- Cook the potatoes in the microwave at full power (900W) for 10 minutes, stir halfway through.
- Cut the carrots into _julienne_ strips and cook them in the microwave at full power (900W) for 2 to 3 minutes. 
- Cut the _shiitake_ mushrooms into small strips.
- Heat the oil and fry the seeds and ginger for a minute.
- Add the carrots and _shiitake_  and fry over high heat for a minute or maybe two, depending on how fine you cut them.
- Add the potatoes and fry over high heat for a minute, add the soy sauce and fry for another minute.
- Add the tofu to the pan, crumble it with your hands or with a spatula.
- Fry for a few minutes over low heat, then lower the heat and let simmer.
- Meanwhile, mix 4 tablespoons of the _shiitake_ soaking liquid with the _miso_.
- Add the mixture to the pan and fry over medium heat until the liquid has completely gone.
