#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients:
  - about 400 g small potatoes
  - 2 large tomatoes (about 200 g)
  - about 200 g spinach
  - 1 tin of chickpeas
  - 1 cm fresh ginger, finely chopped

- From the store cupboard  
  - spices: turmeric, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, cardamom pods, cayenne pepper to taste (I use about a teaspoon of each of the spices and just a pinch of the cayenne pepper)
  - 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
  - 1 tablespoon sunflower seeds
  - 1 tablespoon pumpkin seeds
  - 1 tablespoon of soy sauce
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil
  - 1 teaspoon garlic oil

#### Preparation
- Wash the potatoes and cut them in two. Cook them in the microwave for 5 minutes at full power (900 W), stir, cook for another 5 minutes.
- Slice the tomatoes as fine as you can.
- If you're using whole seeds like I do, grind the coriander seeds, cumin seeds and cardamom pods.
- Heat the oil in a large deep pan. I recommend a non-stick pan with a lid.
- When the oil is hot, add the ginger, seeds and spices and fry over medium heat for a few minutes.
- Add the chickpeas and stir-fry for a few minutes more over high heat.
- Clear some space in the middle of the pan and put in the soy sauce. Stir vigorously.
- Add the tomatoes and stir well. Lower the heat and leave to simmer for a few minutes until the tomatoes have softened.
- Cook the spinach in the microwave at full power (900W) for 1 minute.
- Meanwhile, add the potatoes to the pan, stir until the potatoes are no longer looking white.
- Cut up the spinach. Add the spinach to the pan, stir and let simmer for a few more minutes.
- Add garlic oil to taste.

This is really a complete one-pan meal but sometimes I serve it with rice too.
