This is the first of my "Murakami meals", named after one of my favourite authors, Haruki Murakami. I wrote a [short blog post]({{ site.url }}/articles/murakami-meals) about what I mean by a Murakami meal.
I had aubergines so I decided to prepare them with ponzu (a Japanese dressing). I also made soy beans with _shiitake_ mushrooms and rounded it off with brown rice cooked with _konbu_ seaweed.

This reciped requires 30 minutes soaking time followed by 20 minutes cooking time.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

* Main ingredients:
  - a cup of frozen soy beans
  - 2 medium aubergines
  - 1 cup of brown rice

* For seasoning I used:
  - 5 dried shiitake mushrooms
  - a 2 cm piece of ginger, thinly sliced
  - 1 piece of _konbu_ (about 5x10cm)
  - _ponzu_: a mixture of 
    - 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 
    - 1 tablespoon _yuzu_ juice, 
    - half a tablespoon rice vinegar, 
    - 1 teaspoon _mirin_

#### Preparation

* Soaking: 30 minutes
  - Put the rice and _konbu_ together in a pot with 2 cups of water and soak for 30 minutes in cold water.
  - Meanwhile, soak the shiitake for 30 minutes in a cup of freshly boiled water, then slice them thinly.
* Cooking: 20 minutes  
  - Cook the rice with the _konbu_ for 6 minutes, either on the hob or in the microwave at full power (900W).
  - Meanwhile, cook the beans for 3 minutes in the microwave at full power (900W). Add the _shiitake_ and ginger to the beans and cook for two minutes.
  - Remove the _konbu_ and slice it into smaller strips. Return it to the pot and continue cooking for another 20 minutes or until all the water has been absorbed.  
  - Meanwhile, wash and slice the aubergines.
  - Cook each aubergine separately for 7 minutes in the microwave at full power (900W). Divide the aubergine slices over two plates and sprinkle them with the _ponzu_ dressing.
