#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients:
  - 1 butternut squash
  - 1 pear
  - 1 cm ginger chopped finely
  - 2 tablespoons of lemon juice (or _yuzu_ juice to make it more special)

- From the store cupboard  
  - 1 tin black-eyed beans
  - 2 tablespoons raisins
  - 1 tablespoon of soy sauce
  - some garlic oil
  - olive oil for frying]
  - 2 tablespoons flaked almonds
  - 1 tablespoon sunflower seeds
  - 1 cup of brown rice (I used [Kilombero]({{ site.url }}/articles/my-favourite-types-of-rice/#brown-rice) rice from Malawi)

#### Preparation
- Cook the rice (see <a href="{{ site.url }}/basics">basics</a> for how to cook rice).
- While the rice is cooking:
  - Wash and peel the butternut squash, slice it into thin (3 mm) segments.
  - Do the same for the pear, put some lemon juice on the pieces so they don't turn brown.
  - Wash the beans in a sieve.
  - Cook the butternut squash in the microwave, 3 minutes at full power (900W), stir, then another 3 minutes.
  - Fry the ginger and seeds over medium heat for a few minutes.
  - Add the butternut squash and flaked almonds and fry on high for a few minutes, until the pieces and flakes start to brown.
  - Add the lemon juice lower the heat to medium.
  - Add the beans and the soy sauce and the raisins and fry over medium heat.
  - Add the pear and the garlic oil and stir well.
