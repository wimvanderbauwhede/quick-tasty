This is a very simple stir fry, quick and easy to make. The less common ingredients in this recipe are:

* [dried bean curd sticks](https://shop.waiyeehong.com/food-ingredients/dried-products/dried-beancurd-seaweed/dried-beancurd-sticks-tofu-bamboo-2?language=tw);
* [_hijiki_ seaweed](https://www.japancentre.com/en/products/2872-wel-pac-dried-hijiki-seaweed).
You can find these ingredients in most Asian supermarkets. I also used [_miso_ paste](https://www.japancentre.com/en/products/2051-clearspring-organic-brown-rice-miso). You can find it in most supermarkets.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients & groceries
  - 300 g carrots
  - a medium courgette (about 200 g)
  - 1 cm ginger, chopped very fine
  - 50 g dried bean curd sticks
  - 1 tablespoon _hijiki_

- From the store cupboard
  - 1 teaspoon _miso_ paste
  - 1 tablespoons olive oil
  - 1 teaspoon sesame oil
  - 2 tablespoons pumpkin seeds
  - 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
  - 1 cup of rice (I used basmati)

#### Preparation

- Soak the bean curd sticks in boiling hot water for about half an hour.
- Soak the _hijiki_ in hot water for about half an hour.
- Prepare the rice (see [The Basics]({{ site.url }}/basics/#toc0) for instructions to cook rice).
- Meanwhile:
  - Wash, scrape or peel the carrots and chop them (rather coarsely).
  - Microwave for 3 minutes at full power (900W) (if you like, add a splash of _mirin_).
  - Wash and chop the courgettes.
  - Add the courgettes to the carrots and microwave for another 3 minutes at full power (900W).
  - Pour the cooking liquid into a bowl.
  - Heat the oil in a deep pan and fry the ginger and seeds for a few minutes.
  - Drain the bean curd and chop into sections of 2-3 cm long.
  - Fry the bean curd on medium to high heat for a few minutes.
  - Add the vegetables and fry on medium to high heat for a few more minutes.
  - Drain the _hijiki_ and add to the pan; fry for a few more minutes on low heat.
  - Dissolve the _miso_ in the cooking liquid of the vegetables and add it to the pan.
  - Turn off the heat and stir well until the liquid is absorbed.
- Serve with the rice.
