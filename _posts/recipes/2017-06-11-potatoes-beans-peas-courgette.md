In this recipe I combined [my _umami_ sauce]({{ site.url}}/recipes/udon-carrots-yuba-knots/) with potatoes, soy beans, peas and courgettes.

There is one ingredient in this recipe that may be a bit harder to find, but it is really worth the effort! I bought these at a Chinese supermarket.

* Fermented broad bean paste (called _doubanjiang_ in Chinese) is essential. Make sure to check the ingredients as there are many types of chilli bean paste and a lot of them are not vegetarian. The Chinese characters are 豆瓣酱. If it says 辛豆瓣酱 then it will be very spicy. The brand I got is [Pearl River Bridge Chilli Bean Paste](https://shop.waiyeehong.com/food-ingredients/sauces-oils/other-sauces/chilli-bean-paste-toban-paste).

All the other ingredients can be found in ordinary supermarkets.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

* Main ingredients

    - 400 g potatoes
    - 300 g courgettes
    - 1 cup of frozen peas and soy beans (combined)

* For the sauce

    - 6 dried tomatoes, finely chopped
    - 1 tablespoon tomato puree
    - a handful of dried shiitake
    - 2 tablespoons pumpkin seeds, crushed in a mortar
    - 1 cm ginger, finely chopped
    - 1/2 teaspoon miso
    - 1/2 teaspoon black bean paste
    - 1 tablespoon olive oil
    - 1 teaspoon garlic oil

#### Preparation

Two of the ingredients need soaking: the dried tomatoes and _shiitake_.

- Soak each of these in a separate pot or bowl in freshly boiled water for at least 30 minutes.
- After soaking:
    - Squeeze the liquid out of the tomatoes. Keep the soaking liquid.
    - Wash the _shiitake_, then squeeze the liquid out of them and cut the in strips. Keep the soaking liquid.

- Cook the frozen beans and peas for 2 minutes in the microwave at full power (900 W).
- Wash the potatoes and dice them.
- Cook the potatoes in the microwave for 10 minutes at full power (900 W), stirring halfway through.
- Meanwhile, wash the courgettes and slice them thinly. You can cook them in the microwave for a few minutes at full power (900W) to speed up the frying.
- Meanwhile, heat the oil and fry the ginger for a minute or so.
- Add the pumpkin seeds, the tomatoes and _shiitake_ and fry over low heat for a few minutes.
- Add the potatoes and courgettes and fry over high heat for a few minutes, until the courgettes are soft and the potatoes have browned.
- Add the beans and peas.
- Add the _miso_, black bean paste and tomato puree and two tablespoons each of the soaking liquid of the tomatoes and _shiitake_.
- Cook further for a few minutes over low heat, stirring well.
