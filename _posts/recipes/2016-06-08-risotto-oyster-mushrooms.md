Risotto is a popular Italian-style one-pan dish, delicious and easy to make. It works best with a proper risotto rice like Arborio. I like to serve it with an apple and cherry tomato side salad for contrast. This recipe takes about 30 minutes to prepare.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients and groceries
  - pack of oyster mushrooms (150 g)
  - 1 teaspoon ginger, finely chopped
  - half a cup of grated hard cheese (Grana Padano or Parmezan)

- From the store cupboard
  - 1 cup of risotto rice
  - 2 tablespoons pine kernels
  - 4 dried tomatoes
  - 1 teaspoon turmeric
  - 1 teaspoon ground coriander
  - 1/2 teaspoon salt
  - olive oil for frying (1 tablespoon)
  - 1 teaspoon garlic oil (optional)

#### Preparation

- Boil half a litre of water.
- Use some of it (1 cup) to soak the dried tomatoes.
- While the tomatoes are soaking:
  - Heat the oil and fry the pine kernels, spices and the oyster mushrooms.
  - Add the rice, shake or stir until it's covered with the spices and the oil.
  - Add some hot water (just enough to cover the rice) and simmer, covered, until the rice has absorbed the water.
- Add the tomatoes and their soaking liquid, and some more boiled water, stir and simmer, covered, until the rice has absorbed all the liquid.
- Add the salt and more water, stir and simmer, covered, until the rice has absorbed the water.
- You may have to add water a few more times, depending on how much you added at a time.
- It's ready when the rice is quite creamy (in Italian it's called _all'onda_, "wavy").
