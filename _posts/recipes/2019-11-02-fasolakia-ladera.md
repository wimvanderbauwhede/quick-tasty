In October I went on a research retreat in Greece. The food was delicious. Celeste from Artisa, who runs the retreat, is an excellent cook and by popular demand she [published a cookbook](https://artisagreece.org/artisa-food-cookbook-with-delicious-vegetarian-meals/). This recipe is my adaptation of Celeste's recipe for "Fasolakia ladera" (Φασολάκια λαδερά), green beans in tomato sauce.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients & groceries
  - 375 g green beans (I used stringless runner beans)
  - 4 small potatoes (150 g)
  - 2 cm ginger, finely chopped  
  - 2 large beef tomatoes (300 g)
  - half a cup of fresh mint leaves

- From the store cupboard
  - 1 cup rice (I used Basmati)
  - 4 tablespoons tomato puree
  - 1 teaspoon sugar
  - 1 tablespoon pine kernels
  - 1 teaspoon garlic oil
  - 4 tablespoons olive oil
  - salt and pepper to taste (I added 1/4 teaspoon salt, and sprinkled some pepper on serving)


#### Preparation

- Wash the tomatoes, chop them fine and cook them in a large pot in the microwave for 5 minutes at full power (900W). Stir and cook for another 5 minutes.
- Meanwhile,
  - Cook the rice (see ["The Basics"](http://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/basics/#toc0) for how to cook rice).
  - Wash and clean the beans and break them in two or three pieces.
  - Wash the potatoes and cut them in 4 pieces (no need to peel them).
  - Heat the olive oil and garlic oil in a large deep pan and stir-fry the ginger and beans for about 5 minutes over high heat.
  - Add the pine kernels at the end and fry for another minute or so until they start to brown. Take care as they burn very easily.
- Add the content of the pan to the pot with the tomatoes.
- Add the potatoes, the tomato puree and the sugar.
- Cook in the microwave for 5 minutes at full power (900W).
- Add the fresh mint leaves.
- Cook in the microwave for a further 5 minutes at full power (900W), and then 5 minutes are reduced power (300 W).
- Leave the dish for a few minutes before serving.
- Cut the feta in thick slices, season with olive oil and oregano.
- Serve with the feta and rice and season with pepper to taste.
