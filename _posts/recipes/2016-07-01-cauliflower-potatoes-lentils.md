Stir-frying the cauliflower and potatoes with seeds and spices gives a nice crunchy texture &mdash; make sure not to overcook the cauliflower. Puy lentils are a great companion for this but if you are really in a hurry, you can leave them out and add some goat cheese instead.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients and groceries
  - 1 cauliflower
  - about 400 g small potatoes  
  - 1 cup puy lentils
  - 1 cm fresh ginger, chopped finely
- From the store cupboard
  - 2 dried tomatoes, roughly chopped
  - 1 teaspoon ground cumin
  - 1 teaspoon turmeric
  - 1 teaspoon ground coriander
  - 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
  - 1 tablespoon sunflower seeds
  - 2 tablespoon pumpkin seeds

#### Preparation

- Cook the lentils:
  - Put the lentils, dried tomatoes and cumin in a pot with 2 1/2 cups water (2 cups water for 1 cup lentils, another 1/2 cup for the dried tomatoes).
  - Bring to a boil and let simmer for about 20-25 minutes, stir occasionally.
- While the lentils are cooking:
  - Wash the cauliflower and cut into florets.
  - Wash but don't peel the potatoes.
  - Cook the cauliflower in the microwave for 4 minutes at full power (900W).
  - Cook the potatoes in the microwave for 8 minutes at full power (900W).
  - Heat the oil in a large deep pan. I recommend a non-stick pan with a lid.
  - When the oil is hot, add the ginger, seeds and spices and fry over medium heat for a minute.  
  - Add the potatoes and fry for a few minutes.
  - Add the cauliflower and stir-fry over high heat for a few minutes.
