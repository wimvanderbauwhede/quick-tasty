Ingredients
oil
1 large eggplant, cut into cubes
2 cm ginger, finely chopped
1 teaspoon garlic oil or 2 cloves garlic
tofu sticks for 2 people
1 large tomato, chopped
1/2 tablespoon miso + 1/2 tablespoon tobanjan
1 tablespoons vinegar
0.2l coconut milk
1/4 cup water
0.5 teaspoon sugar
2 mild chili peppers, stemmed and minced
salt and pepper to taste

Instructions
In a wide pan or skillet over medium heat, heat about 2 tablespoons oil. Add eggplant and fry until lightly browned, turning on sides as needed. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels. Keep warm.

In the pan, heat another 1 tablespoon oil. Add ginger and garlic and cook until limp. Add tofu sticks and cook until lightly browned.
Add miso+tobanjan paste and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 3 to 5 minutes or until color darkens.
Add tomatoes and cook, mashing with the back of the spoon, until softened.
Add vinegar and allow to a boil, uncovered and without stirring, for about 3 to 5 minutes or until mostly absorbed. Add coconut milk, water, sugar and chili peppers.

Lower heat, cover, and simmer until liquid is reduced. Add eggplant and continue to cook until liquid is reduced.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.
