Stollen

Based on "Dresdner kerststol"  (p. 335)

- 50 g raisins (I used a cereal topper mix)
- 100 g candied orange/lemon peel
- 300 g marzipan
- 7 g dried yeast
- 700 g white flour
- 0.25 l milk
- 150 g butter

3 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt

+ 50 g butter on top
+ 2-3 tablespoons icing sugar

- I did the recipe as in the book, which is basically making bread, except that with the dried yeast it does not need to sit for very long. 
- Also, I mixed the butter in the milk, heated it very slightly in the microwave.
- I had to add a little extra water
- I turned the loaf halfway (after 8 mins) during the first 15 mins 200 deg bake and every 15 minutes during the 1-hour 180 deg bake.
