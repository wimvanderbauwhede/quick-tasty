#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients and groceries
  - a cup of green peas (I use frozen ones)
  - a teaspoon of finely chopped or grated ginger
  - some grated hard Italian cheese (grana padano or parmezan) or pesto for serving

- From the store cupboard
  - a cup of risotto rice
  - three  dried tomatoes
  - half a cup of dried porcini mushrooms
  - a handful of pine kernels
  - a teaspoon ground cumin
  - a tablespoon soy sauce
  - garlic oil

#### Preparation

- Boil half a litre of water.
- Soak the dried tomatoes and the porcini in a cup of boiled water each.
- While the tomatoes and the porcini are soaking:
  - If the peas are frozen ones, put them in the microwave with a tablespoon of water for 3 minutes at full power (900W).
  - Heat the oil and fry the pine kernels, ginger and cumin.
  - Add the rice, shake/stir to coat it with the spices and the oil.
  - Add some of the boiled water (just enough to cover the rice) and simmer, covered, until the rice has absorbed the water.
  - Add the tomatoes and porcini mushrooms and their soaking liquid, and some more boiled water. Stir and simmer, covered, until the rice has absorbed it.
  - Add the soy sauce and more boiled water, stir and simmer, covered, until the rice has absorbed the water.
  - You may have to add water a few more times, depending on how much you added at a time.
  - When the rice is getting quite creamy, add the peas. 
  - Simmer for a few more minutes, then drizzle on some garlic oil and serve with pesto or cheese.
