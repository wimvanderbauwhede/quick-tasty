This recipe with dried tofu skin or _yuba_ is inspired by a _fucha ryori_ (普茶料理, Buddhist vegan cuisine) recipe from the [Zen temple cookbook]({{ site.url}}/articles/zen-cooking/) I bought in Japan. My variation is to make _yubamaki_: I wrapped the tofu skins in _nori_ seaweed like a _sushi maki_ roll. The stewed _hijiki_ is similar to [my previous recipe]({{ site.url}}/recipes/iridoufu-hijiki-hourensou/) but with added aubergines. I serve this with Japanese rice.

Dried tofu skin is also called dried (soy) bean curd. The brand I got is [Zheng Feng Dried Beancurd Sheets (正豐三邊腐竹)](http://xinhe.co.uk/dried-preserved/zheng-feng-dried-beancurd-sheets). The _hijiki_ seaweed I used is [Wel-Pac Dried Hijiki Seaweed](https://www.japancentre.com/en/products/2872-wel-pac-dried-hijiki-seaweed). All the other ingredients can be found in ordinary supermarkets.

This recipe takes about 45 minutes apart from the soaking.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

* For the _dashi_

    - a piece of _kombu_ of about 2.5 cm x 10 cm
    - 2 dried _shiitake_ mushrooms

* Main ingredients

    - 2 aubergines (400 g)
    - 2 medium carrots (300 g)
    - 1 cm ginger, finely chopped
    - 4 sheets of dried tofu skins. The sheets I use are about 15 cm x 25 cm. The sheets are quite brittle and might break but don't worry about that.
    - 3-4 tablespoons _hijiki_ seaweed
    - 1 cup Japanese rice (200 g)
    - a sheet of _nori_ seaweed, approx. 20 cm x 30 cm. You need 8 pieces of about 7 cm x 10 cm in total.
    - 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 teaspoon sesame oil for frying

* Seasonings

    - 4 tablespoons soy sauce
    - 4 tablespoons _mirin_

#### Preparation

* Soaking    

    Several of the ingredients for this recipe require soaking:

    - _hijiki_: in 1 l cold water for at least an hour.
    - Japanese rice: wash and strain and let it sit in the sieve for 30 minutes. Then soak in 1.2 cups of cold water for 30 minutes. See [Makiko Itoh’s site _Just Hungry_](http://justhungry.com/handbook/cooking-courses/japanese-cooking-101-lesson-2-great-japanese-rice) for a detailed explanation.
    - _kombu_ and dried _shiitake_: in 500 ml water, either overnight in cold water in the fridge or for 30 minutes in hot water. This is _dashi_.
    - tofu skins: in warm water for 30 minutes.

* Cooking

    - Cook the rice (see [_The Basics_]({{ site.url}}/basics) for full details).
    - Heat the _dashi_ in the microwave for 4 minutes at full power (900W), taking care not to boil it. Remove the _kombu_ and _shiitake_ from the _dashi_.
    - Drain the soaking liquid of the tofu skins and roll them up starting from the short side. Wrap any smaller pieces which may have broken off inside the larger ones. Simmer in 250 ml of _dashi_ with soy sauce and _mirin_ (two tablespoons each) for 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let it cool.
    - Cut the aubergines in small chunks and cook them for 7 minutes in the microwave at full power (900W).
    - Cut the carrots in small strips.
    - Heat a tablespoon olive oil and a teaspoon sesame oil in a frying pan with a lid.
    - Fry the carrots and ginger for a few minutes over high heat.
    - Add the soaked _hijiki_ and fry for another minute over medium heat.
    - Add the aubergines.
    - Add 250 ml _dashi_ with soy sauce and _mirin_ (two tablespoons each), cover and simmer over low heat for 20-30 minutes until the carrots are tender.
    - Remove the skin rolls from the pan. Cut each roll in two and wrap each half in a sheet of _nori_ seaweed of about 7 cm x 10 cm. Trim excess tofu skin off the edges.
