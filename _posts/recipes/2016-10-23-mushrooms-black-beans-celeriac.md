This is a suprising and very tasty stir-fry of Japanese mushrooms, black beans and celeriac served with Japanese rice. The black beans I used are the common ones (ブラックビーン, "_burakkubiin_" in Japanese), not the black-skinned soy beans (黒豆,"_kuromame_") because they are hard to find here.
Celeriac is not a common vegetable in Japan either but the taste goes really well with the mushrooms and beans.
