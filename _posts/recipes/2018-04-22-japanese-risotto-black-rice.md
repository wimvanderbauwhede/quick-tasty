This is a risotto but made from [Thai black rice](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shop/gb/groceries/sainsburys-thai-black-rice-500g), cooked with _kombu_ seaweed according to a recipe from the [Zen temple cookbook]({{ site.url}}/articles/zen-cooking/) I bought in Japan.
I added mixed mushrooms and aubergines and serve it topped with _edamame_ soy beans.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

* Main ingredients:
    - 1 pack (200 g) mixed mushrooms (I used oyster mushrooms, _shiitake_ and _eryngii_)
    - 2 small aubergines
    - 1 cup of frozen soy beans (_edamame_)
    - 1 cup black rice

* Seasonings
    - a piece of about 5x10 cm _kombu_ seaweed
    - 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh ginger
    - 2 tablespoons sesame seeds
    - 1 teaspoon _miso_    
    - 1 tablespoon _mirin_    
    - 1 teaspoon sesame oil
    - 1 tablespoon olive oil
    - for serving: _shichimi tougarashi_, golden sesame seeds (optional)

#### Preparation

- It is best (but not absolutely necessary) to soak the rice with the piece of _kombu_ for an hour in 2 cups of cold water. Otherwise, soak for 5 minutes at least in very hot water. Then take out the _kombu_ and cut it into small strips.
- Wash the aubergines and cut into chunks.
- Cut the mushrooms in strips.
- In a deep pan with a lid,  heat the olive oil and sesame oil and fry the ginger, mushrooms and sesame seeds until the mushrooms start to brown.
- Meanwhile, cook the aubergines in the microwave for 8 minutes at full power (900W).
- Add the aubergines, _kombu_ and the rice to the pan with the soaking liquid of the rice.
- Add the _mirin_ and _miso_, stir well to dissolve the _miso_.
- Cook, covered, until the liquid has almost been absorbed, so it's _all'onda_ like a proper risotto.
- Meanwhile, cook the soy beans in the microwave for 3 minutes at full power (900W).
- Serve with the soy beans as topping.
