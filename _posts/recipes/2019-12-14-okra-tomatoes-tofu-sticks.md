This recipe is inspired by [Curried okra with tomatoes](https://www.kawalingpinoy.com/curried-okra-with-tomatoes/) from the [Kawaling Pinoy](https://www.kawalingpinoy.com) Filipino recipe site.
I added [tofu (bean curd) sticks](https://shop.waiyeehong.com/food-ingredients/dried-products/dried-beancurd-seaweed/dried-beancurd-sticks-tofu-bamboo-2?language=tw) and used more tomatoes; also the spices are a bit different.

It takes a bit longer because I used Japanese short-grained brown rice ([Yumenishiki Brown Rice](https://www.japancentre.com/en/products/3274-yumenishiki-brown-rice), grown in Italy) and that takes longer to cook than white rice. The actual preparation time is about 20 minutes.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients & groceries
  - 300g fresh or frozen okra (I could only find frozen)
  - 2 large tomatoes, chopped
  - 50 g dried tofu sticks
  - 2 cm fresh ginger, finely chopped
  - 2 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped  
  - 1/2 cup water

- From the store cupboard
  - 1 cup of rice (I used brown Japanese rice)
  - 2 tablespoons sesame seeds
  - 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
  - 1 teaspoon ground coriander
  - 1 teaspoon ground cumin
  - 1/4 teaspoon _tobanjan_ (or a pinch of chilli powder)
  - 1 teaspoon _miso_ paste
  - 1 tablespoon _yuzu_ juice (you can use lemon, lime or even vinegar as substitute)  
  - 1 tablespoon rapeseed oil or other cooking oil


#### Preparation

- Soak the tofu sticks in very hot water for 30 minutes.
- Meanwhile
  - Cook the rice (as it is wholegrain rice, it takes rather long, up to 45 minutes)
  - Cook the okra 6 minutes (4 minutes for fresh okra) in the microwave at full power (900W), stir every 2 minutes.
  - Heat the oil in a deep pan. When the oil is hot, add the ginger, garlic, sesame seeds and spices and fry for a few minutes over medium heat.
  - Drain the tofu sticks and cut them into pieces.
  - Add the tofu sticks to the pan and cook until lightly browned.
  - Add the tomatoes, okra, _miso_, _tobanjan_ and _yuzu_ juice and cook, stirring occasionally, for a few minutes.
  - Add the water and let it simmer for another 10 minutes or so.
- Serve with the rice.
