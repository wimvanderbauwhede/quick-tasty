This is a one-pot recipe that takes about 20 minutes. It is inspired by a dish we used to eat at a Congolese restaurant many years ago. The original recipe used plantains but they are very hard to find so I used ordinary bananas and parsnips.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients & groceries
  - 2 bananas
  - 1 parsnip
  - 1 sweet potato (350-400 g)
  - juice of 1 lemon
  - half a cup breadcrumbs
  - 1 tin black-eyed beans
  - a piece of ginger, about 1 teaspoon when chopped finely

- From the store cupboard
  - 2 tablespoons sesame seeds
  - 1 tablespoon cashews
  - 1 tablespoon pumpkin seeds
  - 1 tablespoon raisins
  - 1 tablespoon soy sauce
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil
  - 1 teaspoon garlic oil
  - 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (or shichimi)

#### Preparation

- Clean and dice the parsnips and sweet potato and put them in a microwave pot with a few tablespoons of water. Cook for 6 minutes at full power (900W).
- Drain and wash the black-eyed beans and let them leak out.
- Peel and dice the bananas.
- Chop the ginger fine.
- Heat the olive oil and when hot, stir-fry the ginger and seeds and cashews over medium heat for about a minute.
- Add the bananas and the breadcrumbs and stir-fry for a few minutes over medium heat, stirring all the time so the bananas get coated with the breadcrumbs and seeds.
- Add the raisins and stir-fry for about half a minute over high heat, until the bananas start to brown a little.
- Reduce the heat. Add the beans and stir-fry for a few minutes more.
- Add the soy sauce and stir-fry briefly over high heat until it is evaporated.
- Add the lemon juice and stir-fry briefly over high heat, then reduce the heat and stir-fry for a few minutes more.
- The parsnips and sweet potato will be ready by now. Add them to the pan. Add the cayenne pepper and garlic oil, stir and let simmer for about five minutes.
