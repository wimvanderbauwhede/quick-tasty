This is a veggie version of a Filipino recipe, [Binagoongan Baboy sa Gata](https://www.kawalingpinoy.com/binagoongan-baboy-sa-gata/). I added the aubergines to the pan as in [this Binagoongan Talong](https://www.kawalingpinoy.com/binagoongan-talong/) recipe. The less common ingredient in my recipe is [dried tofu (bean curd) sticks](https://shop.waiyeehong.com/food-ingredients/dried-products/dried-beancurd-seaweed/dried-beancurd-sticks-tofu-bamboo-2?language=tw).
