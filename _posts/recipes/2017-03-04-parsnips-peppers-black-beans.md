This is a simple, colourful and very tasty stir-fry of parsnips, baby bell peppers and black beans, served with rice. The "secret sauce" is almond flakes and tomato puree. In our local Chinese supermarket I found ["Healthy Grain Trio Rice"](https://www.orientalmart.co.uk/rice---grains/general/sawat-d-healthy-grain-trio-rice------------), a mixture of brown, red cargo and black glutinous rice and a very nice combination.
