Although this is an _udon_ (Japanese noodle) recipe, it is definitely not typically Japanese. I wanted to create a thick, chunky sauce full of _umami_ and the main ingredient I used was dried tomatoes.

There are a few ingredients in this recipe that may be a bit harder to find, but it is really worth the effort! I bought these at a Chinese supermarket.

* Fermented broad bean paste (called _doubanjiang_ in Chinese) is essential. Make sure to check the ingredients as there are many types of chilli bean paste and a lot of them are not vegetarian. The Chinese characters are 豆瓣酱. If it says 辛豆瓣酱 then it will be very spicy. The brand I got is [Pearl River Bridge Chilli Bean Paste](https://shop.waiyeehong.com/food-ingredients/sauces-oils/other-sauces/chilli-bean-paste-toban-paste).
* For the topping I used dried beancurd twists (called _yuba_ in Japanese, _bai ye jie_ in Chinese), you can of course use another topping. The brand I got is [Yilin Dried Beancurd Twists](https://shop.waiyeehong.com/food-ingredients/dried-products/dried-beancurd-seaweed/dried-beancurd-twists).

All the other ingredients can be found in ordinary supermarkets.

* Main ingredients

    - 400 g carrots
    - 200 g udon noodles
    - 10 dried tofu skin knots

    - 1/2 teaspoon miso
    - 1/2 teaspoon black bean paste
    - 1 tablespoon olive oil
    - 1 teaspoon garlic oil

#### Preparation

Three of the ingredients need soaking: the dried tomatoes, _shiitake_ and the tofu knots (_yuba_).

- Soak each of these in a separate pot or bowl in freshly boiled water for at least 30 minutes.
- After soaking:
    - Squeeze the liquid out of the tomatoes. Keep the soaking liquid.
    - Wash the _shiitake_, then squeeze the liquid out of them and cut the in strips. Keep the soaking liquid.
    - Drain the water from the tofu knots
- Bring water to the boil for the noodles and cook the noodles for 8 minutes.
- Meanwhile, wash, peel and dice the carrots and cook the in the microwave for 4 minutes at full power (900W).
- Meanwhile, heat the oil and fry the ginger for a minute or so.
- Add the pumkin seeds, the tomatoes and _shiitake_ and fry over low heat for a few minutes.
- Add the _miso_, black bean paste and tomato puree and two tablespoons each of the soaking liquid of the tomatoes and _shiitake_.
- Cook further for a few minutes over low heat, stirring well.
