In this recipe I sweetened the aubergines by cooking them together with apples. The chickpeas and seeds make the meal sustaining and add a crunchy texture. This recipe takes about 25-30 minutes to prepare.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients & groceries
  - 2 small aubergines (2x200g)
  - 1 apple (I used Cox but Braeburn or similar will also work. Sour apples like cooking apples or Granny Smith are not so suitable.)
  - 1 lemon
  - 1 tin of chickpeas
  - a piece of ginger, about 1 tablespoon when chopped finely
  - fresh coriander as garnish (optional)

- From the store cupboard    
  - 1 teaspoon allspice
  - 1 tablespoon of soy sauce
  - 1-2 tablespoon sesame seeds
  - 1-2 tablespoon sunflower seeds
  - 3 tablespoon raisins
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil for frying
  - 1 cup basmati rice


#### Preparation

- Cook the rice (see <a href="{{ site.url }}/basics">basics</a> for how to cook rice).
- While the rice is cooking:
  - Chop the aubergines in slices of about half a cm thick.
  - Peel the apple and cut rather finely.
  - Squeeze the lemon into a cup.
  - Put the aubergine slices and apple pieces in a microwave pot and pour half of the lemon juice over it.
  - Cook in the microwave: 6 minutes on full power (900W), stir, then cook for 4 more minutes on full power.
  - Meanwhile, heat the olive oil, and fry the ginger, allspice, sesame seeds and sunflower seeds for half a minute or so on moderate heat, stirring all the time.
  - Add the chickpeas and fry for a few minutes more on moderate heat, stirring all the time.
  - Add the raisins.
  - Pour the soy sauce in the pan, stir well over high heat for about half a minute.
  - Pour the remaining lemon juice in the pan, stir well and let simmer for a few minutes.
  - Add the aubergines, let simmer on low heat for 5 minutes.
  - Optionally, add chopped fresh coriander as garnish.
- Serve with the rice.
