This is a Japanese-style dish called "nabe" or hotpot. It's a one-pot meal, easy to make and great for cold winter days. You need several typically Japanese ingredients for this but I bought everything in the local supermarket except the wakame, which I bought in a local Chinese supermarket.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients & groceries
  - about 400 g small potatoes
  - about 400 g carrots
  - 150 g fresh _shiitake_ mushrooms
  - half a packet of silken tofu (150 g)
  - 1 cm fresh ginger

- From the store cupboard  
  - 1 tablespoon _miso_ paste
  - 2 tablespoon _mirin_
  - a tablespoon of dried _wakame_
  - _shichimi togarashi_ and golden sesame seeds for seasoning (optional)

#### Preparation

- Soak the _wakame_ in about half a liter of water. It will increase in volume by up to 6 times.
- Wash and clean the potatoes, carrots and mushrooms.
- Cut the potatoes in round slices of about 3 mm thick.
- Cut the carrots in pieces of about 2 by 3 cm and about 3 mm thick.
- Cut the mushrooms in strips of about 4 mm thick.
- Slice the ginger as thin as you can.
- Put the potatoes, carrots, ginger and  mushrooms in a microwave pot and add the _mirin_. Cook for 10 minutes at full power (900 W).
- After 10 minutes, take the pot out of the microwave and pour about 100 cl of the cooking liquid into a bowl. Put the _miso_ into the bowl and mix until it is dissolved.
- Drain the _wakame_ and add it to microwave pot.
- Cut the _tofu_ into small cubes (about 1 cm on the side) and add it to microwave pot.
- Pour the miso mixture over it and mix the ingredients taking care not to mash the _tofu_ pieces.
- Cook for 3 minutes at full power (900 W).

Serve and season to taste with _shichimi togarashi_ and golden sesame seeds.
