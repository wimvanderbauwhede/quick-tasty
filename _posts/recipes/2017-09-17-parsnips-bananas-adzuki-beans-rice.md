I set out to make a curry but decided to make it a bit special by adding bananas and adzuki beans. The tastes combines really well with the parsnips.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients & groceries

  - 1 medium parsnip
  - 1 small banana
  - 1 small courgette
  - 1 medium carrot
  - a piece of ginger, about 1 teaspoon when chopped finely

- From the store cupboard  
  - 1 tin of adzuki beans  
  - 1 cup of brown rice
  - 1/2 cup of crumbled toast
  - 1 tablespoon raisins
  - 1 tablespoon pumpkin seeds
  - 1 tablespoon sunflower seeds
  - 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
  - 1 teaspoon ground coriander
  - 1 teaspoon ground cumin
  - 1/2 teaspoon shichimi togarashi or cayenne pepper
  - 1 teaspoon soy sauce
  - 1 tablespoon fruit juice
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil

#### Preparation

- Cook the rice  (see <a href="{{ site.url }}/basics">basics</a> for how to cook rice).
- Clean and dice the parsnip, courgette and carrot and put them in a microwave pot. Cook for 6 minutes at full power (900W).
- Drain and wash the adzuki beans and let them leak out.
- Peel and dice the banana.
- Chop the ginger fine.
- Heat the olive oil and when hot, stir-fry the spices, ginger and seeds over medium heat for about a minute.
- Add the banana pieces and the breadcrumbs and stir-fry for a few minutes over medium heat, stirring all the time so the bananas get coated with the breadcrumbs and seeds.
- The parsnips and sweet potato will be ready by now. Add them to the pan.
- Add the raisins and stir-fry for about half a minute over high heat, until the bananas start to brown a little.
- Reduce the heat. Add the beans and stir-fry for a few minutes more.
- Add the soy sauce and stir-fry briefly over high heat until it is evaporated.
- Add the fruit juice and stir-fry briefly over high heat, then reduce the heat and stir-fry for a few minutes more.
- Add the shichimi togarashi or cayenne pepper, stir and let simmer for about five minutes.
