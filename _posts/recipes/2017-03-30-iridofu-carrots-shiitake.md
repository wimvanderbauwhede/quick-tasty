This is a variation on scrambled tofu or _iridoufu_ (炒り豆腐). I combined the tofu with stir-fried carrots and fresh _shiitake_.

In our local Chinese supermarket I found ["Healthy Grain Trio Rice"](https://www.orientalmart.co.uk/rice---grains/general/sawat-d-healthy-grain-trio-rice------------), a mixture of brown, red cargo and black glutinous rice and a very nice combination. I cook this with _kombu_ seaweed according to a recipe from the [Zen temple cookbook]({{ site.url}}/articles/zen-cooking/) I bought in Japan.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

* Main ingredients:		

    - 1 block of firm tofu 200-250 g
    - 300 g carrots
    - 200 g fresh _shiitake_ mushrooms
    - 1 cup of rice

* Seasonings

    - 1 piece of _kombu_ seaweed, about 10 cm x 10 cm (not essential)
    - 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh ginger
    - 2 tablespoons unroasted sesame seeds
    - 1 tablespoon roasted ground sesame seeds
    - 1 teaspoon _miso_
    - 1 tablespoon soy sauce
    - 1 teaspoon sesame oil
    - 1 teaspoon garlic oil
    - 1 tablespoon olive oil

#### Preparation

- Soaking: 30 minutes
    - Put 1 cup of rice and a 10x10cm piece of _kombu_ together in a pot with 2 cups of cold water and soak for at least 30 minutes.

- Cut the tofu into pieces and put it in the microwave for 3 minutes at full power (900W). When it has cooled, squeeze the moisture out of the pieces as much as possible.
- Cook the rice with the _kombu_ for 10 minutes, either on the hob or in the microwave at reduced power (400W).
- Cut the carrots and the _shiitake_ mushrooms into _julienne_ strips and cook them in the microwave at full power (900W) for 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the cooking liquid into a small bowl.
- Remove the _kombu_ from the pot with rice, slice it into smaller strips and return it to the pot. Continue cooking for another 15 minutes or until all the water has been absorbed.
- Heat the oil and fry the unroasted sesame seeds and ginger for a minute.
- Add the carrots and _shiitake_  and fry over high heat for a minute or maybe two, depending on how fine you cut them.
- Add the tofu to the pan, crumble it with your hands or with a spatula.
- Fry for a few minutes over low heat, then lower the heat and let simmer.
- Meanwhile, mix the cooking liquid with the _miso_ and soy sauce.
- Add the mixture to the pan, add the tablespoon of roasted ground sesame seeds and fry over medium heat until the liquid has completely gone.
