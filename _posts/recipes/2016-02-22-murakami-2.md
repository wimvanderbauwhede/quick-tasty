This is the second of my [Murakami meals]({{ site.url }}/articles/murakami-meals). It's a *very* quick meal, hardly any cooking at all!

#### Ingredients

For two people:

* Main ingredients:
  - a pack of _soba_ noodles
  - a cup of frozen soy beans
  - a large carrot
  - a tomato
  - 1/2 teaspoon dried _wakame_ seaweed

* For seasoning I used:
  - some soy sauce
  - a 1/2 cm piece of ginger, thinly sliced
  - some rice vinegar
  - some _ume_ vinegar

#### Preparation

- Soak the _wakame_ seaweed in about half a liter of cold water for about 10 minutes.
- Meanwhile, cook the _soba_ noodles for 5 minutes on the hob. For a great explanation of how to cook _soba_ noodles, see [Makiko Ito's site Just Hungry](http://justhungry.com/basics-cold-soba-noodles-dipping-sauce).
- Meanwhile, cook the beans for 3 minutes in the microwave at full power (900W).
- Wash and slice the tomato and the carrot.
- Strain the _wakame_.
- Serve in four bowls:
  - the carrots seasoned with _ume_ vinegar and rice vinegar and a little soy sauce,
  - the tomato slices seasoned with rice vinegar and soy sauce,
  - the beans with soy sauce and some ginger,
  - the _wakame_ seaweed.
- Serve the noodles in bowls. Sprinkle with some _shichimi_, sesame seeds (_irigoma_) and soy sauce. おいしい！
