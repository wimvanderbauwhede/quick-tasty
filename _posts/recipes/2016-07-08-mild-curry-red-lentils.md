This is a recipe for a delicious mild root vegetable curry. The red lentils give this curry a smooth creamy texture. The tomatoes provide some extra fiber and _umami_.

#### Ingredients

For two people:

- Fresh ingredients and groceries
  - carrots, parsnips (250 g)
  - potatoes (250 g)
  - 2 small tomatoes (100 g)
  - 1 cup of red lentils
  - 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh ginger

- From the store cupboard
  - half a cup basmati rice
  - spices: ground cumin seeds (1 teaspoon), ground coriander seeds (1 teaspoon), ground turmeric (2 teaspoons), cayenne pepper or _nanami togarashi_ (Japanese spice mix) (1 teaspoon)
  - seeds and nuts: sunflower seeds and/or sesame seeds (2 tablespoons), ground almonds (1 cup)
  - 2 dried tomatoes
  - 1 tablespoon soy sauce
  - 1 tablespoon oil for cooking (I use olive oil)
  - 1 teaspoon garlic oil (optional)

#### Preparation

* Cook the rice (see <a href="{{ site.url }}/basics">basics</a> for how to cook rice).
* While the rice is cooking:
  * Slice the tomatoes very thinly.
  * Peel and dice the root vegetables, then either steam or microwave (6 minutes at full power 900 W).
  * Cook the red lentils:
    - Put the lentils and chopped dried tomatoes in a microwave pot with 2 cups water.
    - Cook in the microwave for 2 minutes on full power (900W), then for 10 minutes on 50%.
    - Stir; cook for 5 minutes on 50%.
    - Stir, cook on 50% until there is hardly any liquid left in the pot (typically 5 minutes).  
  * Heat the olive oil.
  * Add ginger, spices (except cayenne/nanami) and sunflower seeds, and fry over low heat for a few minutes.
  * Add the tomato slices and fry over medium heat for a few minutes.
  * Add the soy sauce and let it reduce over medium to high heat (this takes just a few seconds).
  * Mix the ground almonds with the lentils and add to the pan, stirring well.
  * Add the cayenne/nanami and stir for another minute.
  * Finally add the vegetables and the garlic oil and let it simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes or so.  
* Serve with the rice.
