  - Wash the mushrooms and chop them in thin slices and add them to the carrots.
  - Add the olives and the pumpkin seeds.

  - Pour this dressing over the vegetables and mix well.

- Toss the pasta in the remaining olive oil.
- Serve the pasta in a deep bowl with the mushrooms and carrots on top.
- Sprinkle on the grated cheese.
