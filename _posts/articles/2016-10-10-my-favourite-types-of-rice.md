I love rice, and most of [my recipes]({{ site.url }}/recipes) go very well with rice. There are many, many varieties of rice, in this post I just want to introduce a the ones I like best and use frequently.

#### Basmati rice

Basmati rice, a fragrant, aromatic rice from India, is my staple, mainly because it has such a short cooking time (just 15 minutes). It is very fluffy [when cooked right]({{ site.url }}/basics/#toc0). I have used it in several recipes, for example my favourite [basmati rice with tomatoes and halloumi]({{site.url}}/recipes/tom-hal/).

#### Brown rice

The [brown rice I use]({{site.url}}/recipes/courgettes-mushrooms-puy-lentils/) is either Basmati or regular long grain rice. The picture shows Kilombero rice from Malawi. Brown rice has a more earthy taste than white rice and takes longer to cook (about 30 minutes). It it a better source of dietary fiber and vitamines than white rice: broadly speaking brown rice contains 3x more fiber and vitamins than white rice. It also contains about 3x more magnesium, phosphorus and manganese; for other minerals (calcium, iron, zinc) the difference is smaller.

#### Red rice

Red rice is a variety of rice with a red colour and a nice nutty flavour. I use [Camargue red rice]({{site.url}}/recipes/aubergine-boats-soy-beans/), but there are other varieties. In terms of cooking time and nutritional value it is similar to brown rice. 

#### Risotto rice

To make [risotto]({{site.url}}/recipes/risotto-green-peas/) you need a rice that can absorb a lot of water so it gets creamy. The typical variety that I use is Arborio, there are many other varieties but they are harder to find. To cook risotto rice you should add the water a little bit at at time, and wait until it has been absorbed, rather than adding it all at once.

#### Japanese rice

For [Japanese style dishes]({{site.url}}/recipes/aubergines-sweet-potatoes-tofu/) you really need proper _Japonica_ rice: the rice grains cling together without being mushy [when properly cooked](http://www.justhungry.com/japanese-basics-plain-rice-sushi-rice). It doesn't necessarily have to come from Japan though: I use either Yumenishiki or Clearspring's sushi rice, both are grown in Italy. Yumenishiki's _koshihikari_ is an actual Japanese variety; the Clearspring rice is an Italian _Japonica_ variety, Selenio, which is very similar in taste and properties to Japanese rice. When I was in Japan I used _kinuhikari_, a local variety that I liked a lot.
