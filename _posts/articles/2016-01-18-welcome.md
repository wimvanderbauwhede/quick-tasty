My aim with Quick and Tasty Cooking is to get more people to cook healthy food and ultimately to write a cookbook and donate the proceeds to the [UN World Food Programme](http://www.wfp.org/). For a publisher to take interest, I need to have many, many followers on Facebook and Twitter. Please help me to achieve this goal by liking my Facebook page or following me on Twitter:

My recipes are quick (really) and easy, don't require any gadgets and use few ingredients &mdash; all of which you can find in the supermarket.

All recipes are my own creation, unless credited. I'll post a new quick & tasty recipe every week.

Wim
