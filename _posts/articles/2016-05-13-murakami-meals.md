As promised in my previous post, [My journey of learning Japanese]({{ site.url }}/articles/learning-japanese/), I will start posting recipes for what I call "Murakami meals", named after one of my favourite authors, Haruki Murakami.

[Haruki Murakami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami) is a bestselling Japanese author. Food is a recurrent theme in his novels.

I love the way he lets his characters prepare food, like Nakata in "Kafka on the Shore" peering in the fridge and whipping up a great meal in no time for himself and Hoshino, or Aomame in "1Q84" eating cucumber with mayonaise, or the narrator in "Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World" cooking for the librarian. <!-- resp p368, p152, p90 -->

<!--
Somebody made a very nice illustration of Nakata with Hoshino eating a bowl of ramen:

What I call a "Murakami meal" is a meal made quickly with what you find in the fridge. And although Murakami frequently lets his characters prepare and eat Western-style food, I'll post recipes for Japanese-style food. Also, of course, my recipes will be vegetarian.

My "Murakami meal #1" is [aubergines with _ponzu_, soy beans with _shiitake_ and brown rice with _konbu_]({{ site.url }}/recipes/#aubergines-ponzu-soybeans-rice).

 tamagoyaki (Japanese-style omelet) with ajizuki nori (seaweed), Japanese-style potato salad and silken tofu. I explain how to make it [on the recipes page]({{ site.url }}/recipes/).
