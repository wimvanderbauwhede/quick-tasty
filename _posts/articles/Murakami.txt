specific writing style

GT: 3 sets + meaning
GT: Also, no spaces - > diff to understand

Furthermore, few distinct sounds

=> no kanji is hard to read


In Japanese, Murakami uses a specific writing style to express Fuka-eri’s way of speaking. 
Japanese has three sets of characters: _hiragana_ and _katakana_ which are phonetic alphabets, and Chinese characters (_kanji_). Normally, _kanji_ are used to indicate the meaning of words, _hiragana_ is used to express the grammar and _katakana_ is used for foreign words or as a kind of italics. Japanese has few distinct sounds, there are lots of homonyms, and the _kanji_ disambiguate the meanings for the homonyms. 
However, _katakana_ and _hiragana_ can be used to phonetically write _kanji_ but sentences without _kanji_ can be difficult to read, especially because no spaces are used between words. Murakami renders Fuka-eri’s speech using _hiragana_ and _katakana_ characters only, without _kanji_.
