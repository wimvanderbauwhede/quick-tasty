I am currently reading the original Japanese version of "Tokyo Ueno Station" by [Yu Miri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miri_Yu),『JR上野駅公園口』. It's a very nice but difficult novel, I may write more about it later. After I wrote the [article on the Buddhist prayer "The Four Wisdoms"]({{site.url}}/articles/four-wisdoms), I came across a passage in the novel that describes a Buddhist funeral and it contains a prayer used by the  Jōdo Shinshū (浄土真宗, "The True Essence of the Pure Land Teaching"),  known as Shinshū in Japan. 

## The prayer

The prayer in the book is written in archaic Japanese with old forms of _kanji_ and grammar and uncommon words:

　 　 　 　 長 本 浄 娑 ツ 佛 イ 弘<br>
　 　 　 　 時 師 土 婆 子 恩 ヅ 誓<br>
　 　 　 　 ニ 釋 无 永 ニ フ レ ノ<br>
　 　 　 　 慈 迦 爲 劫 弥 カ ノ チ<br>
　 　 　 　 恩 ノ ヲ ノ 陀 ク ト カ<br>
　 　 　 　 ヲ チ 期 苦 ヲ オ キ ラ<br>
　 　 　 　 報 カ ス ヲ 念 モ ニ ヲ<br>
　 　 　 　 ズ ラ ル ス ズ ヒ カ カ<br>
　 　 　 　 ベ ナ コ テ ベ ツ 娑 フ<br>
　 　 　 　 シ リ ト 、 シ 、 婆 ラ<br>
　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 ヲ ズ<br>
　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 い バ<br>
　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 デ<br>
　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 ン<br>

## The puzzle

I could not understand the poem, but I was curious about its meaning so I tried to find out. First of all, here is a list of the special _kanji_, words and constructions that I did not understand: 

- 弘誓 (ぐぜい, _guzei_): [Buddha's universal vow](http://bschawaii.org/shindharmanet/bloom/ab-writings/salvation/) 
- 娑婆 (しゃば, _shaba_): The [Sahā world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sah%C4%81), the mundane world.
- 佛: an older form of 仏 (_butsu_), Buddha 
- 仏恩 (ブツオン、ぶっとん, _button_): Buddha's blessings, the grace of Buddha's compassion
- 弥陀 (みだ,_mida_): Amitabha (a [celestial Buddha](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Buddhism/Celestial-buddhas-and-bodhisattvas), the principal buddha in Pure Land Buddhism)
- 永劫 (えいごう, here pronounced _yōgō_): Eternity, perpetuity. 劫 (_kō_ or _gō_) means [kalpa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalpa_%28aeon%29).
- 浄土 (じょうど, _jōdo_): Lit. "pure land", esp. the [Western Pure Land](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sukhavati) paradise of Amitabha.
- 无爲: old kanji for 無為 _mui_: [asaṃskṛta](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110810104405611), _the ‘unconditioned’, a term referring to anything that transcends conditioned (saṃskṛta) existence in the state of saṃsāra._
- 期スル (ごする,_go suru_): to live
- 本師 (ホンシ,_honshin_): Lit. "fundamental guru", i.e. Buddha 
- 釋: an older form of 釈, lit. _shaka_, short for _Shakamuni_ (釈迦牟尼), the historical Buddha. 
- 慈恩 (じおん_jion_): deep compassion, benevolence
- ナリ: なり (_nari_) is the classical version of である, "to be".
- ベシ: べし (_beshi_) is the classical version of べき, "something one ought to do". In the prayer, 念 ずべし means 念 ずるべき,"should pray", and 報 ずべし means 報 ずるべき, "should inform".

With these terms and the _furigana_ in the novel, I could do a transcription in _romaji_:

_guzei no chikara wo kafurazuba_<br>
_idzure no toki ni ka shaba wo iden_<br>
_button fukaku omohitsu,_<br>
_tsune ni mida wo nen zubeshi_<br>

_shaba yōgo no ku wo sute,_<br>
_jōdo mui wo go suru koto_<br>
_honshi shaka no chikara nari_<br>
_jōji ni jion wo hō zubeshi_<br>

So at least I can now pronounce the prayer, and I get a rough idea of the meaning. But of course I wanted to know the details. 

## The origin

 By searching for snippets rewritten with modern _kanji_ and _hiragana_, I found that the prayer is taken from a book of hymns called _Kōsō Wasan_ (『高僧和讃』, the "Japanese Hymns of Praise of the Virtuous Priest"), a collection of hymns written by the founder of the sect, [Shinran (親鸞)](https://www.learnreligions.com/shinran-449983), who lived between 1173 and 1263 and was a remarkable person.

In particular, these are the two final hymns from "Twenty-six Hymns based on the Writings of Master Shan-tao". [Shan-tao](http://www.chinabuddhismencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=Shan-tao) is one of the seven masters (patriarchs) of Shinshū. He lived from 613 to 681 and is generally credited for popularizing the _nembutsu_ as the reciting of Amida's name (see below).

## The meaning

The complete works of Shinran in English translation are available [on line](http://shinranworks.com/). The [translation of the two hymns](http://shinranworks.com/hymns-in-japanese/hymns-of-the-pure-land-masters/shan-tao/) taken from there is: 

_Had we not received the power of the universal Vow,_<br>
_When can we part from this Saha world?_<br>
_Reflecting deeply on the Buddha's benevolence,_<br>
_Let us think on Amida always._<br>

_Casting off long kalpas of painful existence in this world of Saha,_<br>
_We live in expectation of the Pure Land, the uncreated;_<br>
_That is the power of our teacher, Shakyamuni;_<br>
_Let us respond always in gratitude for his compassion and benevolence._

Pure Land Buddhism holds that there is a kind of Paradise called the Pure Land, and once one is there it is easier to reach Nirvana. Shinran advocated to trust to the power of Amitābha (_Amida_), as made manifest in his Universal Vow, to attain enlightenment. The main Jōdo Shinshū practice is called _nembutsu_, "Mindfulness of the Buddha". The nembutsu is simply reciting the phrase _Namu Amida Butsu_ ("I take refuge in Amitābha Buddha", written 南無阿弥陀佛). For more information see [the detailed discussion of the meaning of the hymns](https://www.shinbuddhism.info/kw86.htm). 

## The conclusion

This is yet another example of how reading Japanese remains a difficult but very stimulating activity for me: there are lots of riddles to be solved. In translation, most of the mystery disappears. And every time I look into such a little mystery, I learn lots of new things.
