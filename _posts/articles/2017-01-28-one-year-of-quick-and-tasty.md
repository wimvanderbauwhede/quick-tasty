A year ago we started [Quick & Tasty Cooking]({{ site.url }}) to bring you tasty, healthy and above all quick recipes. It's been a great year, here are a few highlights:

* We posted [more than 40 original recipes]({{ site.url }}/recipes) in the past year, all of them vegetarian or vegan. 
* Typically, the recipes take [20 minutes]({{ site.url }}/times/#20-minutes) to prepare, and this is really from start to finish, including preparations like washing, peeling and chopping vegetables.
* All ingredients are commonly available in supermarkets.
* You don't need any fancy kitchen gadges like a spiralizer or even food processor. However, there are [a few simple Japanese tools]({{ site.url }}/articles/japanese-kitchen-tools/) that I really like.
* Our [unique battery icon]({{ site.url }}/recipes/#quick) shows the calories for each recipe at the glance. 

Our current favourite is the [stir-fry of mixed mushrooms with black beans, celeriac and potatoes]({{ site.url }}/recipes/). What was yours? Please leave us a comment on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fuss_free_food) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/quickandtasyfood/)!
