If you've tried some [Quick and Tasty recipes]({{ site.url }}/recipes/), you will have noticed that they never contain onion. There is no special reason for this other than that I prefer ginger. So let's make the case for ginger.

Many people don't like onion, raw or cooked. Also peeling and chopping onion is not pleasant, and the smell of onion is hard to wash off your hands. And yet most recipes contain onion. By contrast, few recipes contain fresh ginger. I argue that you don't need onion to make tasty meals, and that you should consider using fresh ginger instead, and I present the [Quick and Tasty recipes]({{ site.url }}/recipes/) as evidence.

The main flavours cooked onion adds to a meal are sweetness and _umami_. But onion is actually not a particularly good source of _umami_. According to the web site of the [Umami Information Center](https://www.umamiinfo.com), onion contains about 20-50&nbsp;mg glutamate/100&nbsp;g. Ginger contains about 20&nbsp;mg as well. For reference, tomatoes &mdash; a great source of umami &mdash; contain almost 250&nbsp;mg glutamate/100&nbsp;g. There are [many other ingredients](https://www.umamiinfo.com) that provide umami.

Ginger has a unique fresh and very spicy taste, especially in raw form, but it does not burn the mouth like peppers. Raw ginger is great to spice up a salad. Frying reduces the spiciness and enhances the sweetness. The change in taste is the result of applying heat ([which transforms _gingerol_ into _zingerone_](https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/09/30/ginger/)) so cooking in the microwave works fine as well, you don't need to actually fry it.

Ginger has [many proven health benefits](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-proven-benefits-of-ginger), but the great taste is reason enough to start using it. Here are a few examples of Quick and Tasty recipes with ginger:

<!-- I find the taste of fried ginger much more interesting than that of fried onion.-->

With raw ginger:

* [Soba noodles with  soy beans]({{ site.url }}/recipes/murakami-2/)

### Appendix: Ginger carbon footprint

Most fresh ginger in the UK is imported from China (somewhat surprising as India is the main producer), so you might be concerned about your ginger carbon footprint. I calculated that the contribution of the ginger to my carbon footprint is at most 0.01%.

- The [CO2 footprint of shipping](http://www.worldshipping.org/industry-issues/environment/air-emissions/carbon-emissions) is 10&nbsp;g per km per 1,000&nbsp;kg of freight.
- The [distance from China](https://sea-distances.org/) is 19,000&nbsp;km.
- My ginger consumption is about 100&nbsp;g per 2 weeks (7-10&nbsp;g per meal), so about 2.5&nbsp;kg per year.

So we have

    10*19,000*2.5/1,000 =19*25 = 475

or about half a kilogram CO2 per year.

Using the [WWF carbon footprint calculator](http://footprint.wwf.org.uk/), I estimate my carbon footprint to be 7-12 tons of CO2 per year.
This means that my ginger consumption accounts for no more than 0.5/7,000 or 0.0071% of my yearly carbon footprint.
