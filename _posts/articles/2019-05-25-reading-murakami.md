As mentioned in [previous posts]({{site.url}}/articles/learning-japanese/), I started reading Murakami's 1Q84 in Japanese in October 2014, after I had been learning Japanese for about three years. The paperback (_bunko_, 文庫) edition consists of 6 volumes, two volumes for each of the three Books that make up 1Q84. Each volume is about 400 pages. In July 2016 I finished the first volume. It is now May 2019 and I have finally finished the four volumes comprising Books 1 and 2.

At first, my reading speed was very slow, about half an hour per page, because I constantly had to look up kanji and grammar constructs. In the last three years, my reading speed has fortunately improved quite a bit: it takes me now five minutes to read a page in Japanese. However, to read the equivalent English translation takes only one minute, so I still have some way to go. 

As my reading improved, I started to use different ways of reading.

I am taking a break from 1Q84 and instead I started reading "Lizard" (Japanese title _tokage_ とかげ), a collection of short stories by Banana Yoshimoto, my other favourite Japanese author. It's very interesting to read a different author because it shows that what I have learned by reading Murakami is mainly how to read Murakami. It is taking me quite a while to get used to Banana Yoshimoto's use of style, vocabulary and grammar.

## Reading aloud

In Japanese, "reading aloud" is called _rōdoku_ (ろうどく, 朗読), a word I quite like because _rō_ means "melodious, clear, bright, serene, cheerful". 

Maybe somewhat surprisingly, it turns out that [silent reading is a relatively young development](https://qz.com/quartzy/1118580/the-beginning-of-silent-reading-was-also-the-beginning-of-an-interior-life/): before the 17th century, reading essentially meant reading aloud. 

I find reading aloud very useful because it helps me to understand the flow of the sentence and I also find it easier to understand the meaning. There are many other benefits to reading aloud, as explained in [this article on Voices.com](https://www.voices.com/blog/7_ways_reading_aloud_improves_your_life/).
 A small disadvantage is that I can get stuck on any kanji for which I don't know the pronunciation -- I find it hard to continue without looking it up right away in my dictionary. Still, I like to read aloud also because I simply like the sound of Japanese. 

## Reading without vocalising

When reading Japanese silently (_mokudoku_ もくどく, 黙読), I usually [subvocalise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subvocalization), i.e. I hear the text in my head. However, I found that _not_ doing this has some interesting advantages. I am of course not the first one to make this observation, see e.g. [Significance of Silent Reading](http://www.theindependentbd.com/magazine/details/8098/Significance-of-Silent-Reading), but these are my observations for the particular case of reading Japanese as a non-native. 
For one, I don't get stuck on unknown kanji readings, so my flow is not broken so easily. Also, it means that I go straight from word shapes to meanings. For example, I do not need to know that 菜食主義者 is pronounced _saishokushugisha_ (さいしょくしゅぎしゃ) to know that it means "vegetarian" (菜 _sai_ is vegetable, 食 _shoku_ is to eat, 主義 _shugi_ is doctrine and 者 _sha_ is person). Even for new words it is often possible to tell the meaning from the kanji -- one of the advantages of a writing system based on logograms. 
When not vocalising, it is not necessary to read every individual character. In Japanese the grammar is usually conveyed using groups of hiragana characters and I find that just geting the overall shape is enough to see if a sequence of characters is a negation, or a polite suffix etc. And finally it allows me to [speed-read](https://www.irisreading.com/speed-reading-tips-5-ways-to-minimize-subvocalization/): I can simply scan the text for kanji that indicate the "interesting" parts. And I can now add speed reading to my vocabulary as well: _sokudoku_ (そくどく, 速読).
