You can find all the ingredients used in the recipes in the supermarket.
<!-- except some of the ingredients for typical Japanese meals.-->

The <a href="#starterkit">Condiment Starter Kit</a> lists all the condiments you need for my recipes. The <a href="#survival">Survival Store</a> lists the food items that I have in the cupboard because I use them a lot, but also so that I can cook up a meal in an emergency. And the <a href="#special">Specialty Corner</a> is a short list of the less common ingredients, mainly for Japanese food.

## The Condiment Starter Kit<a name="starterkit"></a>

There are a few condiments that I use quite a lot. If you have these you can make all the recipes.

### Nuts and Seeds

Nuts and seeds are very tasty when roasted, and provide a very interesting texture as well.

* pumpkin seeds
* sunflower seeds
* sesame seeds
* walnuts
* cashew nuts

### Spices

![Ginger]({{ site.url }}/images/ginger_400x300.jpg)

I use ginger and cumin in many of the recipes. Turmeric, coriander and cardamom are for the more curry-style recipes.

* fresh ginger
* cumin seeds
* turmeric
* coriander seeds
* cardamom pods

### Other condiments

![Dried tomatoes]({{ site.url }}/images/dried_tomatoes_400x300.jpg)

Dried tomatoes are my favourite condiment because they add a lot of taste to the food and make it look nice too. Dried mushrooms are great for risottos and similar dishes.

* dried tomatoes (just dry, not in oil)
* dried mushrooms (porcini or mixed)
* olive oil
* soy sauce (make sure it is "real" soy sauce, made from soy, wheat and salt and nothing else)
* rice vinegar, wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar
* garlic oil, not essential but very nice!

![Rice]({{ site.url }}/images/rice_400x300.jpg)

These are items that keep for a very long time and allow you to whip up a meal in an emergency.

* rice (I usually use basmati because it has a great taste and it cooks very quickly)
* pasta (I keep both Italian-style pasta and Japanese-style noodles)
* chick peas (dried or tin)
* frozen peas and/or soy beans
* silken tofu, this is tofu (soy bean protein) in tetra pak.

## The Specialty Corner<a name="special"></a>

![Seaweed]({{ site.url }}/images/seaweed_400x300.jpg)

These are a few ingredients used in Japanese dishes. They may be a bit harder to find in the supermarket:

* shichimi togarashi, a Japanese spice mixture.
* mirin, a sweet rice wine for cooking.
* miso paste, a paste made from salt and fermented soy beans, somewhat similar to vegetable stock cubes but much nicer.
* wakame seaweed, for use in stews and miso soup.
* konbu seaweed, for making dashi, the base for many Japanese dishes.
* hijiki seaweed, great for stews and salads.
