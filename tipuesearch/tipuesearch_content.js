I like to cook but I don’t have much time as I have a full-time job. So I focus on tasty, healthy meals that are simple and easy to make in a short time. I mostly use ingredients that are easy to find in any supermarket, and most of my recipes take less than 30 minutes to put on the table. My goal with Wim’s Quick and Tasty Food is to promote vegetarian and vegan cooking, as reducing meant consumption is one of the most effective climate actions. I’ve lived in Japan for a short time and I’ve been influenced by the Japanese articles/kitchen, with its emphasis on simplicity, and so I have included some Japanese recipes as well.

All of these are actually very easy. Cooking rice Cooking rice is very easy. The basic rule is: use 2 cups water for 1 cup rice (for Basmati it is only about 1.2 cups for 1 cup rice, for Japanese rice it is 1.1 cup water for 1 cup rice). The cup I use is 200 ml. I wash the rice a few times to get rid of dust and also of the rice flour from polishing. For Japanese rice, you should not just rinse it but also actually “wash” the rice by gently rubbing the grains together between your fingers. A detailed explanation can be found at Makiko Itoh’s site Just Hungry. To cook the 1 cup of rice in the microwave: Put the rice with the water in a microwave-compatible pot with a lid Cook at full power (900W) for one and a half minutes Cook at reduced power (40%, 360W) for 15 minutes. For basmati or Japanese rice this is enough; wholegrain rice takes more time, about 25 minutes. Check if all the water is gone, if not give it another 5 minutes, then check again. To cook the 1 cup of rice on the hob: Put the rice with the water in pot with a lid Bring to the boil Cook over low heat for about 15-20 minutes. For basmati or Japanese rice this is enough; wholegrain rice takes about 25-30 minutes.

Cooking potatoes If you use the microwave, cooking potatoes is again very easy: Wash the potatoes and cut out any eyes or damaged parts, but don’t peel them. You can either cook large potatoes whole or chop them up into small chunks. If you like them whole, pierce them several times with a fork. Put in the microwave at full power for about 10 minutes (for 500g potatoes). Check if they are ready by pricking with a fork or just tasting. If they are not ready, give it another 5 minutes, then check again. Wash the potatoes and cut out any eyes or damaged parts, but don’t peel them.

If they are not ready, give it another 5 minutes, then check again. You can of course cook them on the hob as well but the microwave is a better option, it is quicker and the cooked potatoes taste better too. Cooking pasta Pasta is one of the few foods that I do not cook in the microwave, because you need a large pot with plenty of water. My approach is a bit different from what most other people do, but again very easy: Bring 2 l of water to the boil with a bit of salt (say 1/2 tsp) When the water is boiling heavily, add the pasta (100 g per person) and stir until all the pasta is submerged. Cook for 3 minutes in heavily boiling water, without a lid. Take the pot off the hob, put the lid on and let it stand for the remainder of the time indicated on the package. For example if the cooking time on the package says 12 minutes (quite typical), then leave it for 9 minutes. Strain, sprinkle with some olive oil and serve.

There is no special reason for this other than that I prefer ginger. So let’s make the case for ginger. Many people don’t like onion, raw or cooked. Also peeling and chopping onion is not pleasant, and the smell of onion is hard to wash off your hands. And yet most recipes contain onion. By contrast, few recipes contain fresh ginger. I argue that you don’t need onion to make tasty meals, and that you should consider using fresh ginger instead, and I present the Quick and Tasty recipes as evidence. The main flavours cooked onion adds to a meal are sweetness and umami. But onion is actually not a particularly good source of umami. According to the web site of the Umami Information Center, onion contains about 20-50 mg glutamate/100 g. Ginger contains about 20 mg as well. For reference, tomatoes — a great source of umami — contain almost 250 mg glutamate/100 g. There are many other ingredients that provide umami. Ginger has a unique fresh and very spicy taste, especially in raw form, but it does not burn the mouth like peppers. Raw ginger is great to spice up a salad. Frying reduces the spiciness and enhances the sweetness. The change in taste is the result of applying heat (which transforms gingerol into zingerone) so cooking in the microwave works fine as well, you don’t need to actually fry it. Ginger has many proven health benefits, but the great taste is reason enough to start using it. Here are a few examples of Quick and Tasty recipes with ginger: With raw ginger: Salad: Asparagus and paneer on a bed of rocket and courgettes Soba noodles with soy beans Salad: Asparagus and paneer on a bed of rocket and courgettes Soba noodles with soy beans With cooked ginger: Simple winter hotpot with root vegetables and adzuki beans Potato and vegetable bake with cream cheese Simple winter hotpot with root vegetables and adzuki beans Potato and vegetable bake with cream cheese With fried ginger: Mild root vegetable curry with paneer and rice Iridofu with carrots and shiitake Mild root vegetable curry with paneer and rice Iridofu with carrots and shiitake Most fresh ginger in the UK is imported from China (somewhat surprising as India is the main producer), so you might be concerned about your ginger carbon footprint. I calculated that the contribution of the ginger to my carbon footprint is at most 0.01%. The CO2 footprint of shipping is 10 g per km per 1,000 kg of freight. The distance from China is 19,000 km. My ginger consumption is about 100 g per 2 weeks (7-10 g per meal), so about 2.5 kg per year. The CO2 footprint of shipping is 10 g per km per 1,000 kg of freight. The distance from China is 19,000 km. My ginger consumption is about 100 g per 2 weeks (7-10 g per meal), so about 2.5 kg per year. So we have or about half a kilogram CO2 per year. Using the WWF carbon footprint calculator, I estimate my carbon footprint to be 7-12 tons of CO2 per year. This means that my ginger consumption accounts for no more than 0.5/7,000 or 0.0071% of my yearly carbon footprint.

The study A few days ago a new study was published saying that “Eating more fruits and vegetables may prevent millions of premature deaths”. The media message was that we should eat “10 portions of fruit/veg per day”. But what did the paper really say, and how much is this “10-a-day” anyway? What the study did was looking at a large number (92) of other studies on this topic. The study does not actually mention “10 portions”, instead they looked at fruit and veg intake up to 800g/day. This is twice the official UK recommendation of 400g/day, hence the “10-a-day”. For comparison, the US recommendation is “1.5–2.0 cups of fruit and 2–3 cups of vegetables daily”, and as a cup is 240ml, this is considerably more than 400g/day. I have read the paper and I think this is a reliable study with a sound methodology. The main uncertainty I think comes from the fact that in the individual studies (what they call “cohort studies”), the amounts of fruit and vegetables consumed are self-reported by the participants using food-frequency questionnaires. This has been shown to lead to overestimating the consumption due to “social approval bias” (eating more fruit is good). It is not clear if the cohort studies corrected for this factor; in any case this would not change the observed trends. What about the health benefits? The paper shows that the relative risk of death from coronary heart disease, stroke and cancer is lower for people who eat more fruit and vegetables. As you can see from the figure below (Fig. 6 in the paper), eating 400g/day (“5-a-day”) already leads to a significantly lower risk. To put this into perspective, the relative risk of death from coronary heart disease for men of age 40-44 due to smoking is 6.3. That means that smoking increases your risk by more than 6 times compared to not smoking. By comparison, eating 800g/day instead of 400g/day reduces your relative risk from 0.75 to 0.70 compared to eating no fruits or vegetables at all. The key message of paper is that, assuming there is a causal link, then the percentage of deaths per year due to coronary heart disease, stroke and cancer that could have been avoided by eating 800g fruit/veg a day was 9%, whereas for 500g fruit/veg a day it was 6% (in the UK). So increasing intake from 500g/day to 800g/day would result in 3% fewer deaths, or 14,000 deaths prevented (total number of deaths from these causes was 315,000/year in the UK). The unknown factor is of course if the reduced risk is only because of the diet or if people who eat more fruit and vegetables have lower risks due to other causes as well. Is 800g/day a lot or not? A typical meal contains about 300g vegetables per person. A piece of fruit (say an orange, apple or a banana) typically weighs 100-200g, so two pieces of fruit a day is on average 300g. So eating 600g fruit and vegetables per day is actually very easy to achieve. If your other meals also contain some fruit or vegetables then even 800g/day is really not hard. So don’t be daunted by the “10-a-day’!

If you have these you can make all the recipes. Nuts and seeds are very tasty when roasted, and provide a very interesting texture as well. pumpkin seeds sunflower seeds sesame seeds walnuts cashew nuts pumpkin seeds sunflower seeds sesame seeds walnuts cashew nuts I use ginger and cumin in many of the recipes. Turmeric, coriander and cardamom are for the more curry-style recipes. fresh ginger cumin seeds turmeric coriander seeds cardamom pods fresh ginger cumin seeds turmeric coriander seeds cardamom pods Dried tomatoes are my favourite condiment because they add a lot of taste to the food and make it look nice too.

So I had to go and buy everything — great fun when you’re jet-lagged. I went to a supermarket and bought amongst other things a very sharp knife (partly showing on the banner of the recipes page), a great versatile microwave pot (featuring on the banner of my post about the microwave), and the cheap-but-beautiful black-and-red bowls. I also bought three kitchen tools that I particularly like: ##A flexible, antibacterial cutting mat This mat contains a phytoncide, an antibacterial organic compound derived from plants. To kill all the germs you simply put it in the microwave for a minute. And it can go in the dishwasher as well. You can buy it on line, just search for “phytoncide cutting board”. ##A pair of bamboo cooking chopsticks Long chopsticks are great for cooking pasta or noodles. No risk of burning your fingers and handier than a fork too. You can easily find plain ones but I liked the sakura decoration (cherry blossoms), and it actually has ridges for a better grip. ##A rice scoop Japanese rice is different from other rice in the way it sticks together: when properly cooked, each grain is still quite firm but the grains have a sticky outer layer. That’s why every Japanese kitchen has a rice scoop like this, with little nobs that stop the rice from sticking to it. The scoop can be put upright on its handle, very nifty!

Haruki Murakami is a bestselling Japanese author. Food is a recurrent theme in his novels. I love the way he lets his characters prepare food, like Nakata in “Kafka on the Shore” peering in the fridge and whipping up a great meal in no time for himself and Hoshino, or Aomame in “1Q84” eating cucumber with mayonaise, or the narrator in “Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World” cooking for the librarian. What I call a “Murakami meal” is a meal made quickly with what you find in the fridge. And although Murakami frequently lets his characters prepare and eat Western-style food, I’ll post recipes for Japanese-style food. Also, of course, my recipes will be vegetarian. My “Murakami meal #1” is aubergines with ponzu, soy beans with shiitake and brown rice with konbu.

There are many, many varieties of rice but in this post I just want to introduce the ones I like and use frequently. Basmati rice, a fragrant, aromatic rice from India, is my staple, mainly because it has such a short cooking time (just 15 minutes). It is very fluffy when cooked right. I have used it in several recipes, for example my favourite Basmati rice with tomatoes and halloumi. The brown rice I use is either Basmati or regular long grain rice. The picture shows Kilombero rice from Malawi. Brown rice has a more earthy taste than white rice and takes longer to cook (about 30 minutes). It it a better source of dietary fiber and vitamines than white rice. Broadly speaking brown rice contains 3x more fiber and vitamins than white rice. It also contains about 3x more magnesium, phosphorus and manganese; for other minerals (calcium, iron, zinc) the difference is smaller. A brown rice meal of 200 g cooked rice will get you about 40% RDA of phosphorus and vitamin B6, 10% RDA of magnesium and vitamin B3. Brown rice goes really well with lentils. Red rice has a nice nutty flavour. I use red rice from the Camargue region in France. This is a recent variety, a result of cross-pollination of cultivated white rice with wild red rice in the 1980s. In terms of cooking time and nutritional value it is similar to brown rice. For an unusual recipe with red rice, check out my aubergine boats with soy beans and red rice. To make risotto you need a rice that can absorb a lot of water without getting sticky. To cook risotto rice you should add the water a little bit at at time, and keep stirring until it has been absorbed, rather than adding it all at once. Through constant stirring, the outer part of the rice grain is ground off by the friction and the starch mixes with the cooking liquid and turns into a creamy sauce that binds the grains together. The typical variety that I use is Arborio. My favourite risotto is the one with oyster mushrooms. For Japanese-style dishes you really need proper Japonica rice: the rice grains cling together without being mushy when cooked properly. It doesn’t necessarily have to come from Japan though. I use either Yumenishiki or Clearspring’s sushi rice, both are grown in Italy. Yumenishiki’s koshihikari is an actual Japanese variety; the Clearspring rice is an Italian Japonica variety, Selenio, which is very similar in taste and properties to Japanese rice. When I was in Japan I used kinuhikari, a local variety from Kyoto. A nice Japanese-style recipe is aubergines, sweet potatoes, tofu and wakame with rice.

Build a core set of recipes To make a quick meal it is important that you don’t have to think about it. By having a set of ten to twenty favourite recipes, you can quickly make what you like and have a wide variety. Use fresh vegetables for taste I think it is really essential to use fresh vegetables in a meal. Vegetables make the meal balanced; fresh vegetables simply taste so much better than the ones in tins or jars. Don’t overcook This may sound totally obvious, but cook the food for the shortest possible time. Many vegetables don’t need to be cooked at all. All you want is that they are hot and maybe slightly softened. They will taste at their best too. Overcooking your food takes longer and destroys the taste. Add umami Umami is a loanword from the Japanese which can be translated as “pleasant savory taste”, and it is one of the five basic tastes. Even after adding spices, nuts, etc., you may find the food is still not “tasty” enough. That means you need to add some umami. Ingredients that contain a lot of umami are dried tomatoes, dried mushrooms, hard cheese, miso, soy sauce, seaweed, garlic, and also beans (in particular fresh soy beans). Think about texture We appreciate food through more than the taste and smell. The way food feels when you eat it — smooth, crunchy, etc. — is equally important. Vegetables are great for texture, this is another reason not to overcook them. For extra crunch you can add seeds or nuts, for more “bite” dried mushrooms are great, for example. Make a one-pot meal Part of the difficulty with cooking is having to multitask with several pots on the hob. Making a one-pot main meal is much simpler and quicker, because you have only one thing to attend to. Use the microwave The microwave oven is much underrated for cooking. It has the advantages of preparing food quickly, preserving more of the nutrients, and it is hassle-free: you don’t have to watch it and there is less cleaning-up afterwards too.

You only need flour, water and salt. The whole process takes about five hours, but the total amount of active work is only half an hour. The videos and blog from Bake with Jack helped me a lot. Apart from an oven, you will need the following items: A container of about 500 ml for the sourdough starter. I use a plastic mug with a lid, it does not have to close tightly. A glass jar is fine too. A container of about 500 ml for water. A spoon or fork for mixing. A recipient to mix your dough. It should hold least 2 or 3 l, for example a plastic pot or stainless steel cooking pot. I can strongly recommend the Lekue Bread Maker, a silicone bread mould that can go straight into the oven. Optional: a baking tin to shape your loaf. With my recipe, the dough is quite wet so it does not keep its shape well. I use the Lekue for this. Optional: articles/kitchen scales. Mine is a very plain model from Salter. Optional: a thermometer to make sure your water is at the right temperature. Not essential, but handy. A container of about 500 ml for the sourdough starter.

Mine is a very plain model from Salter. Optional: a thermometer to make sure your water is at the right temperature. Not essential, but handy. The difference between sourdough bread and ordinary bread is that you use a sourdough starter instead of baking yeast. The great thing about a sourdough starter is that you can very easily make it yourself, from just flour and water. Have a look at my recipe. For this loaf I only use four ingredients: 150 g sourdough starter 450 g water 675 g wholemeal wheat flour 8 g salt 150 g sourdough starter 450 g water 675 g wholemeal wheat flour 8 g salt First add 150 g starter to your mixing container. Then add 450 g water Then add 675 g flour Then add 8 g salt Mix thoroughly Knead for about ten minutes Leave to rise in a cold oven. I put a tray with hot water in the oven and let the dough rise there, so it keeps warm and wet. After 30 minuts, fold the dough 12 times. “Folding” means that you pull on the dough, which is very elastic, and fold the pulled flap over the main ball of dough. The Bake with Jack video shows very clearly how to do this. Leave for an hour Fold 6 times; leave for an hour Fold 6 times; leave for another hour Preheat the oven on 230 °C Fold another 6 times As you can see from the picure, I sprinkled some pumpkin seeds on top. Bake for 20 minutes at 230 °C. I put a small container with very hot water on the baking tray to get some steam. Bake for another 40 minutes at 200 °C. Leave to cool on a rack. First add 150 g starter to your mixing container. Then add 450 g water Then add 675 g flour Then add 8 g salt Mix thoroughly Knead for about ten minutes Leave to rise in a cold oven.

The videos and blog from Bake with Jack helped me a lot. In particular, I use his method for making the sourdough starter, with only a minor tweak. Making a sourdough starter is very easy. Most recipes use wholemeal rye flour but I use wholemeal wheat flour which is a little less sour. This recipe is for 150 g sourdough starter, which is the amount I use for a single loaf. Take a container of about 500 ml. I use a plastic mug with a lid, it does not have to close tightly. Add 25 g flour and 25 g water at 35 °C, mix (I use the handle of spoon), leave for 24 hours at room temperature (20-25 °C; the warmer, the quicker). Repeat for three consecutive days. It should roughly double in volume. If so, it’s ready to use; if not, leave it for another day. Take a container of about 500 ml. I use a plastic mug with a lid, it does not have to close tightly.

It should roughly double in volume. If so, it’s ready to use; if not, leave it for another day. Once you have made this starter, keeping it going it is very simple. When you make your first loaf with a fresh starter, leave about 20 g starter in the container to make your next batch. I just keep this in the fridge. Then, the day before I bake the next loaf, in the morning, add 75 g water at 35 °C and 75 g flour to the container, stir well, and leave it at room temperature for a day. Put it in the fridge before you go to bed. The next day, take the started out of the fridge 3-4 hours before you start to bake. Because you have now 170 g starter in the container, you can use 150 g for the loaf and then feed the starter again, for as long as you like.

At the Disaster Prevention Research Institute of Kyoto University, researchers are modelling the flow of the wind over the city. The wind that blows over the tiny machiyas of Gion and around Kyoto station with its tall hotels and the Tower. In spring, it scatters a storm of sakura petals all over the city. In the rainy season, it blows down from Arashiyama along the waters of the Katsuragawa, and carries streams of clouds over the hills. When the temple ponds are full of lotus flowers, it stirs the lanterns and chases the incense smoke, and cools the faces of the teams that pull the Yamaboko along Shijou Doori. At the end of summer, when the higanbana is blooming, that same wind follows the railway line to Uji and blows in through the open window of the researchers’ offices, rifling the stacks of diagrams that reveal its very flow. But sometimes that flow gathers to a tremendous strength, and then a typhoon will lacerate the city. The models of the wind predicts this, to make sure the people of Kyoto are prepared. Then Kyoto hunkers down, and waits. When the storm has passed, the sky is a transparent clear and blue. The wind of Kyoto is once again cool and mild, blowing gently over the city.

As a result, the dough is not as easy to knead and much more sticky. This is why we use the “folding” technique as explained in the videos from Bake with Jack. Another great tip from that video is to sprinkle your hands with water instead of flour to stop the dough from sticking to them. With the extra water the dough rises a lot better, so the result is a more open texture. Add all ingredients to your mixing container Mix thoroughly Knead for about ten to fifteen minutes Leave to rise in a cold oven. I put a tray with hot water in the oven and let the dough rise there, so it keeps warm and wet. After half an hour, fold the dough 12 times. “Folding” means that you pull on the dough, which is very elastic, and fold the pulled flap over the main ball of dough.

Japanese Zen Buddhism has a long tradition of what is called “temple cuisine”, a refined and essentially vegan way of cooking. When I was living in Japan, near Kyoto, there was a Zen temple close by, the beautiful Manpukuji. In the shop of the Manpukuji temple I bought this cookbook (in Japanese only) about “fucha ryori” (Zen temple cuisine): The book is full of delicious-looking pictures of the recipes, like this one: What is very different from a regular cookbook is the way the recipes are described: typically, there is a list of ingredients but no amounts, and the method of cooking is described but usually no cooking times are given. Clearly, these details are not the essence of Zen cooking. On the other hand, for every recipe the book mentions if it is for spring, summer, autumn or winter. This connection with the seasons is of great importance in Japan. Also, the the recipes give detailed instructions related to the way the prepared food looks. The aesthetic aspect is as important as the taste. So maybe we can express the Zen way of cooking like this: 普茶料理とはただ材料を選び食を作って盛るばかりなる本を知るべし “To cook the Zen way, just take the right ingredients, prepare the food, then serve it properly.” Fuss-free food Updated April 06, 2016 About Blog Terms About Blog Terms © 2024   Jekyll theme Skinny Bones","tags":"","url":"articles/zen-cooking/index.html"}, {"title":"Why the 'Little People' say 'Ho ho'","text":" Why the 'Little People' say 'Ho ho' As mentioned in previous posts, I have been reading Haruki Murakami’s 1Q84 in Japanese (very slowly). After reading some reviews I wrote a blog post on why some of the characters frequently repeat one another, something critics didn’t like. Another thing several critics didn’t like is the Little People saying “Ho ho”. So let’s have a look at this “Ho ho”. But first, in case you didn’t read the book, a quick setting of the scene may help. Air Chrysalys In 1Q84, there is a “book in the book” called “Air Chrysalys” (kuukisanagi, 空気さなぎ). This book is a kind of fairytale told from the perspective of a ten-year-old girl who lives in a rural commune. As punishment for letting an old mountain goat die, she gets locked up in a shed with the dead goat for a period of ten days*. One night, the “Little People”** appear from the mouth of the dead goat. This scene starts with one of my favourite descriptions in the Japanese text: あたりが暗くなると、死んだ山羊の目が星明かりを受けてきらりと光った。 atari ga kuraku naru to, shinda yagi no me ga hoshiakari wo ukete kirari to hikatta. In the English translation by Jay Rubin, this reads: When darkness falls, the dead goat’s eye sparkles in the starlight. The Japanese sentence sparkles a bit more because kirari to means “with a momentary flash of light” and hikatta means shine or glitter. Murakami puts the reader nicely on the wrong foot, because when six small figures emerge from the goat’s mouth, the little girl thinks “This is like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but there is one missing”. The “Little People” read her thoughts and when she counts again there are seven of them. Together with the girl they start to make an “air chrysalys” by pulling white threads out of thin air and weaving a kind of cocoon from them. While doing so, they talk to the girl. “Ho ho,” says the keeper of the beat The Little People don’t have names or personalities and indeed it is impossible to keep them apart or even describe them in detail, but they have distinct voices. Usually, each of them speaks a short sentence in turn. There is a recurrent pattern where one of them, in translation called the “keeper of the beat”, says “Ho ho”, and the others chorus “Ho ho”: ｢ほうほう｣はやし役のリトル・ピープルがはやした ｢ほうほう｣残りの六人が声を合わせた “houhou” hayashiyaku no RITORU PIIPURU ga hayashita “houhou” nokori no rokunin ga koe wo awaseta In the Japanese text, the “keeper of the beat” is called hayashiyaku (はやし役) and calls out houhou (ほうほう). This matters because if this “Ho ho” was merely an interjection or exclamation, it would likely be written hoohoo (ほぉほぉ or ほおほお). So we can assume that houhou has a meaning. Japanese has many homonyms and this is no exception. There are several possible ways to write houhou, in hiragana or kanji (Chinese characters), each with a different meaning. According to Kotobank, houhou (ほうほう) means ① 物を投げたりたたいたりする音、またはそのさまを表わす語。ぽんぽん。 “The sound of repeatedly throwing or striking something, or a word to representing it” One of the kanji writings of houhou (ほうほう) is 彭々), which makes the meaning more clear because the character 彭 means “the sound of a drum”. Because Murakami wrote the word in hiragana, we can’t be entirely sure, but the meanings of the other kanji writings (這々 perplexity, 方法 method) do not make much sense in the given context. The link with Noh theatre One of the Little People, who Murakami calls the hayashiyaku, calls out “Ho ho”, and the other six echo this in chorus. The translator of the book, the great Jay Rubin, translates hayashiyaku as “keeper of the beat” to reflect the meaning of houhou as drum beat, and also because Murakami uses the verb hayasu which literally means “to keep time”. So “says the keeper of the beat” is a very nice way to translate this. But the literal meaning in Japanese is “member of a hayashi”, and hayashi (囃子) is the four-piece orchestra in the traditional Noh theatre, consisting of three drummers and a flutist. The task of the drummers is to keep the rhythm (hayasu), but they also use their voices to create drum calls. Another component of Noh is the chorus, usually six to eight people. And finally there are the actors, who unlike in traditional Western theatre do not ony speak their own lines, but can also ‘describe events from the perspective of another character or even a disinterested narrator’. With this interpretation, Murakami allocates to his seven Little People the roles of actors, chorus and orchestra in a Noh performance, all at the same time, with an audience of one, the little girl. I think this is what lies behind the Little People saying “Ho ho”.   * In Japan, traditionally a month is split in three ten-day periods called jun(旬). ** Murakami calls them リトル・ピープル (RITORU PIIPURU) which is katakana rendition of the English “Little People”. The little girl thinks of them as kobito (小人) which also means “little people”.

Going vegan is great but there are some common pitfals if you come from a omnivorous diet. Just cutting out all non-plant-based food might leave you feeling dissatisfied, and craving some of your old food. If your vegan meals are not nutritiously balanced, this will also affect your health. Both are common reasons why people give up on a vegan diet. The good news is that making balanced and tasty vegan meals is quite easy. You could of course just make one of my recipes, but if you want to make your own, here are a few simple guidelines, supported by expert nutritional advice. But let’s first have a look at the fundamentals of a healthy diet. Fundamentals of a healthy diet A healthy diet should provide your body with the following: Proteins, for growth and maintenance. Our bodies do not use the proteins we eat directly, but break them down into amino acids. There are nine essential amino acids which we must obtain from our diet to prevent protein-energy malnutrition. Making sure our meals contain sufficient amounts of these is easy, there are several foods such as beans and pulses that are “complete proteins” which provide all essential amino acids. Vitamins and minerals , nutrients our bodies need in small amounts to work properly and stay healthy. From this angle, there is not much difference between a vegan diet and other diets, with the exception of vitamin B12. As there are no plant-based sources, this needs to be taken as a supplement. Essential fatty acids , needed for many physiological processes, including maintenance of cell membrane structure and skin integrity. There are only two of them, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Again, they are easy to add to your diet: several types of nuts, seeds and vegetable oils are good sources. Carbohydrates, for energy and to aid digestion. Although recently “carbs” got a bad reputation, they are really essential for a healthy diet. There are three main types of carbohydrates: sugar, starch, and fibre. For a healthy diet we need all of them, in the right amounts. The main sources are typical starchy foods like rice, pasta and potatoes. The less refined the food, the better as a source of fibre.

So how do you make sure you get all these on a daily basis? I use as a very simple rule that my meals should have: A source of protein. Based on the “Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score”, the best sources are tofu, soy beans, chick peas and black beans, but other types of beans or pulses are good too. I use about 100 g per person per meal. A source of starchy carbohydrates, such as rice, pasta and other grain-based foods, or potatoes and similar root vegetables. For rice or pasta I use about 100 g per person per meal, for potatoes about 250g (uncooked weight). A source of fresh vegetables, whatever you like, but as much variety as possible. These provide you with vitamins and some of the minerals, as well as some carbohydrates and protein. I use about 200 g per person per meal (uncooked weight). Some nuts or seeds, like pumkin seeds, sunflower seeds or walnuts. These are great sources of omega fatty acids and minerals. Just a handful is enough. A source of protein.

Like all his novels, this novel is many things. For this article I want to view it as a reflection on morality. Almost all of the characters have to make complex moral choices based on incomplete or incorrect information. One such character is Tamaru, a bodyguard and security expert in the service of a rich old widow who has embarked on a personal crusade against domestic violence. He is at the same time a very cultured person and a consummate professional. But this article is really about a something that puzzled me. In one of the final chapters (Chapter 25 of Book 3), just before he has to make a very hard moral choice, Tamaru recounts an interesting story about the famous Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jung. He explains how Jung lived in a large house in Zürich, but wanted a place to think and work in solitude. So he built a place which he called the “Tower”, in Bollingen near the shore of the Zürich lake. He built it with his own hands from stones from a local quarry, and had to join the guild become a licensed stone mason to be allowed to do so. It was an austere place, without gas, electricity or running water. On the lintel above the entrance, Jung engraved a phrase which in Japanese reads: 冷たくても、冷たくなくても、神はここにいる Tsumetakutemo, tsumetakunakutemo, kami wa koko ni iru In the English translation by Philip Gabriel, this runs “Cold or Not, God Is Present”. This phrase is also the title of the chapter, and I think that because of this story about Jung, this chapter might very well be the key chapter of the entire novel. I was intrigued by the phrase and started to read up on Jung, to try and find out more about this story. It turns out that the story as told by Tamaru is not entirely accurate: Jung did indeed build the tower with his own hands. He started building it in 1923, when he was 48, and worked on it and reshaped it for most of the rest of his life [1]. And he did put an inscription above the entrance of the original tower. It is the same inscription that was first engraved over the entrance of his house in Küsnacht [2]. However, the words as mentioned by Tamaru are different from the inscription. The original inscription is in Latin and reads “Vocatus atque non vocatus deus aderit”, which translates as “Bidden or unbidden, the god will be present”. The origin of this phrase is interesting: the Latin phrase is from the Adagia, a collection of sayings from ancient sources collected by Erasmus. The actual source is the “History of the Peloponnesian War”, written around 400 BC by the Athenian historian and general Thucydides. In it, he recounts how the Spartans asked the Oracle of Apollo in Delphi if it would go well with them if they went to war with Athens. The oracle answered that if they put all their strength into the war, victory would be theirs, and that “the god himself would be there, whether invoked or uninvoked” [3]. Jung himself knew this background, and he commented “It says: yes, the god will be on the spot, but in what form and to what purpose? I have put the inscription there to remind my patients and myself: Timor dei initium sapientiae.” (Fear of God is the start of wisdom) [4]. Jung’s view on religion was that people need a God because a person needs to recognise a higher authority than the ego. Without a God, a person will make a God out of something else. So there will be a God in people’s lives, whether they want it or not, for good or for worse. Hence the choice of the phrase. As the original phrase is different from Tamaru’s quote, either Tamaru has it wrong, or in the parallel universe of 1Q84, the inscription is different. That is of course very well possible: as the novel makes clear, 1Q84 is superficially the same as 1984 but differs from it in many subtle ways; Tamaru being a person who is very precise in his mental habits, it is not so likely that he would not have checked the translation of a phrase which he considers so important. In fact, he comments that “There’s some deep allusion here, something difficult to interpret.”. So I am assuming that in the 1Q84 universe, the inscription is different. I am of course not the first one to point this out [5], and several people have surmised that this is a pun on cold/called, [6,7] because a possible English translation of the Latin phrase is “Called or uncalled, God is present”. As explained above, this is only one possible translation – “vocatus” could be translated as “bidden” or “summoned” as well, and “the god” is more accurate than “God” – and somehow I find this theory not satisfactory. At first sight, the cold/called theory may seem to be corroborated because Tamaru mentions that the Catholic orphanage where he grew up was always cold, even in summer. However, in Japanese, Tamaru there uses the word “samui” (寒い) which means that it felt cold to him, whereas in the phrase he uses the word “tsumetai” (冷たい), which means that something is cold. Because of his experience in that cruel place, he also says that as far as he is concerned, if God existed, He could not be said to be kind at all. The Japanese adjective shinsetsu (親切,しんせつ) which he uses means “kind,” but is used to describe the character of someone based on their actions. I am therefore inclined to interpret the “tsumetai” as “emotionally cold, unfeeling, indifferent”. In other words, God is here, but we don’t know if he is indifferent or not. That is to my mind also closer to Jung’s own interpretation of the Latin phrase, and yet different of course, as might be expected in 1Q84. I don’t think it is a coincidence that Murakami introduces Jung at the end of this novel. Arguably, the actions of many of the characters match Jung’s views on good and evil. For example Ushikawa, who is the protagonist of the chapter, and quite a creep, is at some point shown his dark side (what Jung calls the Shadow) but decides to embrace it instead of reject it. And it is not a stretch to view the Little People as a kind of collective god: they have no individuality but collectively they have supernatural powers. They are also clearly not bound by human morals, and are (not unlike the Greek gods) quite indifferent to the fate of humans. And they speak through a human, i.e. a prophet, or an oracle. Considering that Jung developed the theory of the collective unconscious, and the notion of archetypes, having a collective god seems fitting. The banner picture of this article is the cover of the 2nd volume of Book 3 in the Japanese paperback. In Japanese, “1Q84” and “1984” are both pronounced as “ichi-kew-hachi-yon”, that’s why this is written underneath the title. The cover illustration for each volume is a detail of “The Garden of Earthly Delights” by Jheronimus Bosch.

This is a twin post, the other version is on Eidon’s blog. Here is the finished track. We hope you like it! Your browser does not support the audio element. Eidon says: “It all started from the title, really. “Daffodils”. Nice word, which reminds of many things – an Arcadia of beautiful flowers and their scent, or Wordsworth’s famous poem, for instance. Among the many spurious thoughts that such a word could evoke, there was one that triggered the resolve to create a piece of music from it: the presence of letters that can be interpreted as note names, together with others that can not. Of the many possible mappings, this one was chosen: where ‘real’ notes where used when a music counterpart existed, and `imaginary’ (inaudible) notes otherwise. The singular form led to 8 quavers and an easy 4/4 metre. The result was found sufficiently interesting and worth pursuing, and a composition was started from there. Three voices, initially appointed two two electric guitars and electric bass, with the theme exposed and repeated by the first guitar, soon joined by the cortege of its companions, all moving in an ostinato slow-pace. In retrospective, it is possible that, from the very beginning, it all was leading to Wordsworth’s poem – the choice of the tempo, for instance. Whatever the actual case, at some point it became clear that the connection with “I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud” had to be made explicit. At first we thought to only sing the poem’s final verses; and then Wim had the great idea to recite the whole poem. The track was created with TuxGuitar, a nice tabulature editor whose notes input interfaces include guitar fretboards. So yes all the instruments you can hear in Daffodils have been composed… on guitar ^_^. Some of the sounds were produced via the Timbres Of Heaven soundfont, while for others we used MuseScore, after importing MIDI files exported from TuxGuitar. MuseScore is much more powerful than TuxGuitar. It allows to orchestrate voices from multiple soundfonts at the same time, for instance, and to export the voices as separate audio files. Once the voices have been chosen and isolated, we used Audacity to orchestrate them together. The original TuxGuitar voices were then mixed with MuseScore voices from the Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra, and the Nice Keys Suite soundfonts, plus that of a Steinway piano. Audacity is perhaps not the best tool one could use, though it has certain valuable features. One such feature is so-called Envelope Tool: with it, it is possible to finely control the volume of each voice. This allows fade-ins and fade-outs, and thus can simulate the entrance and exit of instruments. This has been used extensively in Daffodils! “ Wim says: “Eidon wrote this great track “Daffodils” as he explained above, and he sent me a draft and asked if I could recite the verses from Wordsworth’s poem. I don’t know what he thought my voice would contribute to the work, maybe he wanted a Flemish-Scottish accent? Eidon had in mind that I would recite the final two verses only: And then my heart with pleasure fills, And dances with the articles/daffodils. But I misunderstood him, and I recited the entire poem. That turned out to be serendipitous, as we are both happy with the final result. But I’m running ahead of myself. I used my laptop’s built-in mic as that is all I have. The audio quality is acceptable but far from great, so from the start I had this idea that I wanted to apply some distorting effects to the voice. I thought it might work well with the track which is quite modern and rather different from what a more conventional composer might associate with the image of daffodils. I’d never done this before, so it was an interesting experiment. I used Audacity for the recording and for all processing. I recorded the audio in two takes, and combined the best parts. There is nothing to say about the recording: I just read the poem out loud, at a pace that seemed natural to me. First I improved the audio quality. I knew from past experience that a good way to do it is to apply the following effects:Noise Reduction with default settingsEqualisation (Graphic EQ) with the “Bass Boost” presetCompressor with default settingsReverb with the “Vocal I” preset I then also doubled the voice, with a very slight shift between the tracks, so there is no perceptible echo but the sounds is a little bit fuller. Initially I had wanted to use only the vocoder. But Audacity’s Vocoder effect is not quite what I had in mind. The default setting for the Vocoder results in a rather tame distortion. My settings are The result is a bit like speaking through a tube, with added radar needles, a series of short pulses which give a robotic effect. I found that the Phaser could introduce some interesting distortions. Again, the default effect is quite tame. I used the following setting, on a separate copy of the voice track: The result is a space-like oscillator sound overlaying the speech. I was still not happy with the result so I added another copy of the voice track Reverb using the “Church Hall” preset, which gives a huge echoing sound. I combined these three tracks with the original one, taking care that I did not entirely drown out the recitation. I then combined this track with Eidon’s music. I tweaked the pauses between the verses to match the music and tweaked the volume of the voice here and there. The final verses are repeated three times, because somehow I thought that fit with the music. “ Eidon says: “No greater bias than the authors’ opinion, maybe, though we are quite pleased with the results. Music and verse dance together, and hearts with pleasure fill. Therefore, it is likely that this first move into musical/poetical co-creation shall be followed by new experiments soon! “ The track is available on: OpenTube: PeerTube.uno Funkwhale.it OpenTube: PeerTube.uno Funkwhale.it Our album “Daffodils and Other Flowers” is available on Funkwhale.it. “Daffodils” and “Daffodils and Other Flowers” is © 2020 Eidon and Wim. https://octodon.social/@wim_v12e, Eidon@tutanota.com.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. “Daffodils” and “Daffodils and Other Flowers” is © 2020 Eidon and Wim. https://octodon.social/@wim_v12e, Eidon@tutanota.com.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

It was expanded for the second movie, “Innocence”. I was in particular intrigued by the “Puppet Song” in Innocence, and tried to unwrap the many layers behind it. Ghost in the Shell In 1995, the first “Ghost in the Shell” anime was released, based on the 1991 manga koukaku kidoutai (攻殻機動隊, “mobile armoured riot police”) by Shirō Masamune. It’s a cyberpunk, near-future science fiction anime about cyborgs and to my mind it deals with the question of what makes a human human. It is one of my favourite anime, and one of the reasons for this is the score by Kenji Kawai. In particular, the film has a very striking opening theme sung by a choir, “謡I - Making of Cyborg”. The character 謡 (uta) indicates that the song is a traditional folk ballad or chant, otherwise the more common character for “song” 歌 (also uta) would be used. There are three of these chants in the movie, but I want to focus on the first one. Making of Cyborg When listening to this song, what struck me is that it sounds similar to the choral songs of “Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares”, which was the name of a 1975 recording of Bulgarian folk songs performed by the Bulgarian State Radio & Television Female Vocal Choir. It only became widely known after being re-released by the British independent record label 4AD in 1986. As it turns out, this is not a coincidence: in an interview, the composer explained he had wanted a chorus in Bulgarian style but using Japanese folk singers. According to the Japanese Wiki, he used only three singers for the recording. The result is a very interesting combination of a traditional Bulgarian mode with Japanese lyrics and singing style. What is also very interesting is the nature of the song: it is intended to be similar to a traditional Japanese wedding song, but as far as I could gather the composer wrote the lyrics. He used a very archaic style, dating back to the Heian period (794 to 1185, when Kyoto became the capital) or even the earlier Nara period (710 to 794, when Nara was the capital). The original lyrics are: 吾が舞へば 麗し女　酔ひにけり 吾が舞へば　 照る月　響むなり 結婚に　神降りて 夜は明け　鵺鳥　鳴く In hiragana this reads: あがまへば くわしめ　よひにけり あがまへば てるつき　とよむなり よばいに　かみあまくだりて よはあけ　ぬえとりなく And in romaji: agamaeba kuwashime yoinikeri agamaeba terutsuki toyomunari yobai ni amakudarite yo wa ake nuetori naku I based my translation on a modern Japanese version of the archaic Japanese: 私が舞うと　 美しい女が酔った 私が舞うと　 照る月が　鳴り響く 結婚するために　神が天から　降りてきて 夜が明けて　鵺鳥が　鳴く My translation is: As I dance, the beautiful woman is enchanted As I dance, the shining moon reverberates The god descends from heaven to get married The night turns into day and the thrush cries The last words in the song quite dramatically change the atmosphere because of the negative connotations of the cry of the nue. A few notes: “to get married”: the word used in the song is yobai ni, where yo (夜) means “night” and bai (這い) “to crawl”. In the Heian era, a nobleman sneaking into a lady’s bedroom at night constituted a marriage proposal. There are many examples in the famous novel The Tale of Genji. The lyrics in kanji above have “結婚に” (kekkon ni) which means to get married. “The thrush cries”: the specific bird is White’s Thrush. Nowadays, 鵺 nue also refers to a mythological creature, a Japanese version of the chimaera, but that was not the case in the Heian era. Nevertheless, the cry of this bird is an ill omen. “to get married”: the word used in the song is yobai ni, where yo (夜) means “night” and bai (這い) “to crawl”.

Nowadays, 鵺 nue also refers to a mythological creature, a Japanese version of the chimaera, but that was not the case in the Heian era. Nevertheless, the cry of this bird is an ill omen. Innocence In 2004, the second Ghost in the Shell anime, “Innocence”, was released, with the same director (Mamoru Oshii) and continuing the themes from the first movie but with a much more explicit exploration of the philosophical themes through quotes and imagery. Also there are more pronounced archaic elements, for example sometimes the characters use archaic Japanese, and of course there is the famous parade scene. I think this anime is a masterpiece. But my focus is again only on the opening theme song, the Puppet Song. The Puppet Song (I) The full title of the song is kugutsu-uta: uramite chiru (傀儡謡「怨恨みて 散る」, くぐつうた「うらみてちる」) which means “Puppet song: The flowers resentfully fall” (the word “flowers” is not present in the title but implicit from the lyrics). A translation I found in many places is “The flowers grieve and fall” but 怨恨 is not grief but resentment, even hate. The song is in the same choral mode as “Making of Cyborg”. The harmony and delivery are also quite similar but the melody is distinctly different. Musically, another notable difference is that the composer expanded the choir from three singers to 75. The live performance of this song with the full choir is very impressive. The lyrics are written in a similar archaic style, but they are longer and a lot less straightforward. The original lyrics are: 一日一夜に　月は照らずとも 悲傷しみに　鵺鳥　鳴く 吾がかへり 見すれど　花は散りぬべし 慰むる　心は　消ぬるがごとく 新世に　神集いて 夜は明け　鵺鳥　鳴く 咲く花は　神に祈ひ祷む 生ける世に 吾が身悲しも 夢は 消ぬ 怨恨みて 散る In hiragana this reads: ひとひひとよに　つきはてらずとも かなしみに　ぬえとり　なく あがかへり　みすれど　はなはちりぬべし なぐさむる　こころは　けぬるがごとく あらたよに　かむつどいて よはあけ　ぬえとりなく さくはなは　かみにこひのむ いけるよに わがみかなしも　 いめは　けぬ うらみて ちる And in romaji: hitohi hitoyo ni tsuki wa terazu to mo kanashimi ni nuetori naku agakaeri misuredo hana wa chirinubeshi nagusamuru kokoro wa kenuru ga godoku arata yo ni kamu tsudoite yo wa ake nuetori naku sakuhana wa kami ni kohinomu ikeru yo ni wa ga mi kanashi mo ime wa kenu uramite chiru When I tried to read and understand this text, I got stuck on almost every single line. I was quite surprised to find that almost all the parts that I did not understand occur in the Manyōshū. The Manyōshū The Manyōshū (万葉集), literally “Collection of Myriad Leaves”, is the oldest existing collection of poetry in classical Japanese, compiled during the Nara period. It is extremely highly regarded, for example the name of the current era, 令和 (reiwa) was inspired by one of its poems. It has been studied by scholars for a very long time, and therefore it is possible to find explanations and translations of the poems. The Puppet Song (II) In the original lyrics of the Puppet Song above, each linked phrase occurs in a poem from the Manyōshū collection. It’s quite remarkable that the lyrics of the theme song of a cyberpunk science fiction anime are so strongly inspired by 7th-century classical Japanese poetry. I am also intrigued how the composer could write in such an archaic style, which I assume only very few people master today. And of course this explains why I did not understand so many of the lines. However, thanks to the Manyōshū scholars and a number of existing translations, it was possible for me to put together a translation of the song that I’m happy with, although whether it is correct or not is certainly debatable. Every day, every night, even if the moon does not shine, the thrush cries in sadness I turned and looked back, but the flowers had already scattered; all consolation disappeared from my heart The gods leave to gather in the new world As night turns into day, the thrush cries “Although in this living world we ourselves become sad, at least may our dreams never vanish!” the blossoms beseech the gods, as they resentfully fall A few notes: “even if the moon does not shine”: this is my interpretation of とも. “As night turns into day, the thrush cries”: this is a literal quote from the Wedding Song from Ghost in the Shell. “all consolation disappeared from my heart”: this is a bit free, more literally would be “my comforted heart vanishes irrevocably” “does not shine” and “never vanish”: 照らず and 消ぬ are archaic grammar constructions still in current use (-zu and -nu endings) “the blossoms beseech the gods”: the verb used is kohinomu (to pray), and as this scholar explains , it means “to earnestly pray to the gods (for happiness)”. So “beseech” seems more apt than just “pray”. “even if the moon does not shine”: this is my interpretation of とも. “As night turns into day, the thrush cries”: this is a literal quote from the Wedding Song from Ghost in the Shell. “all consolation disappeared from my heart”: this is a bit free, more literally would be “my comforted heart vanishes irrevocably” “does not shine” and “never vanish”: 照らず and 消ぬ are archaic grammar constructions still in current use (-zu and -nu endings) “the blossoms beseech the gods”: the verb used is kohinomu (to pray), and as this scholar explains , it means “to earnestly pray to the gods (for happiness)”.

I have always liked drawing, and sometimes I use ink and brush. Long ago and far away, in a country over the sea, a fellow PhD student from China made me present of an inkstone. It came in a box with a damasked cloth sleeve which opened like a book. The box itself was covered in bright cerulean fabric and inside it, the stone was cushioned in pink silk. But it is not of the box that I want to talk, beautiful though it is, nor of the stone itself; nor do I want to talk about the inkstick that was enclosed in that same box. It was decorated with a picture of a bird of paradise on a tree with blossoms, all in gold, and it was so pretty I never could bring myself to use it. But with the box came also three additional inksticks, each in its unassuming but stylish cloth-covered small cardboard box, with a white paper label covered in Chinese characters pasted on the top. I couldn’t read them then, and I did not pay much attention; but I noticed that, though the characters where the same on each label, the labels where nonetheless individual. These inksticks are also very pretty, with a rustic river scene on one side and calligraphy on the other. But more on that later. A few days ago, I was making a brush drawing using one of these inksticks, and I happened to look a bit closer at the other markings. On the top it says “油煙一〇一” and on the narrow side “上海墨廠出品”. That means “lampblack 101” and “made by the Shanghai Ink Factory”. I wanted to know more about the meaning of the “101”. And thereby hangs a tale. The history At the start of the Qing dynasty (1636), there lived in Shè Xiàn, Ānhuī province, a master ink maker and artist called Cao Sugong 曹素功 (1615–1689). In the sixth year of the reign of the Kangxi Emperor (1667), he founded the Cao Sugong Ink Factory. Two hundred years later — yet still in the Qing dynasty, in the third year of the reign of the Tongzhi Emperor (1864) — the business moved to Shanghai. It gained a high reputation for the excellence of its ink and won numerous international prizes. The Cao Sugong factory produced four grades of ink: 五石漆烟, 超貢烟, 貢烟, 頂烟, meaning “five minerals (wǔshí) lacquer soot”, “super tribute soot”, “tribute soot”, “top soot”. The grade 五石漆烟 marked the highest quality. However, in 1966, at the start of the Cultural Revolution, one of the most notorious campaigns was the Four Old Things campaign. The Four Old Things were: Old Ideas, Old Culture, Old Customs, and Old Habits (jiù sīxiǎng 旧思想, jiù wénhuà 旧文化, jiù fēngsú 旧风俗, and jiù xíguàn 旧习惯). Characters like “貢” (tribute), with their feudal associations, became unacceptable, and so the grades were renamed to lampblack 101, 102, 103 and 104. In Chinese, lampblack 101 is written “油煙一〇一”, the marking on the top of my inkstick. Furthermore, the Cao Sugong company was combined with several other ink factories and became the “Shanghai Ink Factory”, “上海墨廠”. After the Cultural Revolution, in the 1980s, the Shanghai Ink Factory changed its name back to “Cao Sugong” and the use of the old grades was also reinstated. I got these inksticks in 1992, long after this change back to the old the branding and grading. That means that they were then probably already quite rare items, as the factory only operated as Shanghai Ink Factory for about 20 years in its long and illustrious history. I don’t know for how long these stick were out of production. However, today there are again inksticks sold that look exactly like mine, also labelled “油煙一〇一” (lampblack 101) and “上海墨廠出品” (made by the Shanghai Ink Factory), and these are high-quality items, used by professional ink artists. Like the ones I have, they are not intended for export. These new “101” inksticks are made by the current incarnation of Cao Sugong, after its fusion with famous brush maker Zhou Huchen 周虎臣. Clearly, this particular product has a very high reputation in China, which makes it worthwhile for the company to produce it again, with the original grading and branding from the Shanghai Ink Factory era. The making Did I mention that, when you grind this ink on the inkstone, it produces a very pleasant smell? Making an inkstick requires several steps: the lampblack is refined, mixed with glue and other ingredients. To improve the fragrance, lustre and insect resistance of the inksticks, more than 20 kinds of Chinese medicinal herbs are added, along with gold leaf. The ingredients are mixed by pounding the ingredients with an eight-pound hammer and is very tiring work. Lu Jianqing, the now-retired director of Cao Sugong recalls how, as an apprentice, having to do this thousands of times a day, he couldn’t lift his hand the next day. They are then kneaded by hand, and finally pressed into a wooden mold. This mold is carved with a picture on one side and a related piece of calligraphy on the other. The stick is dried, gold leaf is applied and the decorations are painted on. The process requires four kinds of artists: the ink maker, the carver, the calligrapher and the painter. Cao Sugong inksticks come in three standardised weights: 1 liang (31 g), like the ones I have; 2 liang and 4 liang. The small sticks need to be dried in the shade for six to eight months; the largest ones require up to two years of drying. During the drying period, they need to turned by hand every day because otherwise they would bend out of shape. The whole process is still very artisanal. The poetry The picture on my inkstick shows a bucolic scene along a river. It also has some beautiful calligraphy. I have always been fascinated by Chinese characters, and one day I hope to study Chinese. Not that it would help me with this text, as it is in ancient Chinese. The characters read 水光春色滿江天 At first, I could not find a proper translation, but based on a literal reading of the characters, I interpreted it as river and sky, full of spring colours, light on the water This is the first line of the poem “江南行”, which means “South across the river”. The poem was written during the Tang dynasty (around 831 CE) by the poet Chen Biao (陈标, or 陳票 in traditional characters). Only twelve of his poems are known to exist, but he must once have been a famous poet, as some of his poems are included in the “Shinpenshū”, a collection of poems compiled by the monks of the Kennin-ji temple in Kyoto in the 15th century. Today, he is not well-known at all, which makes the choice of the poem on the inkstick intriguing. It is likely the influence of the artists and calligraphers of the “Chinese Painting Research Academy” (中国画研究院), created in 1981, who worked closely with the Shanghai Ink Factory. This is the poem in full (in traditional characters): 水光春色滿江天，蘋葉風吹荷葉錢。 香蟻翠旗臨岸市，艷娥紅袖渡江船。 曉驚白鷺聯翩雪，浪蹙青茭瀲灩煙。 不怕江洲芳草暮，待將秋興折湖蓮。 I asked on the Fediverse if anyone could provide a translation, and the inimitable L.J. rose to the challenge to produce the following amazing poem: South Across the River The water-light and hues of spring lap up to vaulting blue While winds brush lily pads weighed down with drops like coins aglow. Blue flags and toxicating dregs descend on city shore Such luscious sweetness clad in red across the river rowed. Egrets affrighted by the dawn flock on and on like snow The rolling waves and fodder green like swelling smoke o’erflow. Be not afraid that virtue high will quite desert Jiangzhou Await the autumn days when we will pluck the lotus blow. Translation by L. J. Lee with suggestions from Zoë Camille and cynth And on that wonderfully poetic note I conclude my story of the inksticks from the Shanghai Ink Factory. The background This little story is a patchwork pieced together from a large number of sources brought up by a deep trawl through the net. Here are the most interesting of them: My starting point was the blog of an ink shop in Osaka (in Japanese), which has an article on the 101 grade and on the history of the Shanghai Ink Factory. I found an articles about the history of the Cao Sugong ink shop and about the making of the inksticks. I found a video on Youtube, with English subtitles, about the way inksticks are made at Cao Sugong. The person in the video, Lu Jianqing, started working at the company in 1978 as an apprentice, and became the director in 1989, so he might very well have been involved in the making of my inksticks. There is also an article with great pictures about a different ink factory. This is the site selling copies of my inkstick, there is a nice promo video. This site has the full text of the poem.

Each of the dishes does not take long to prepare (15-20 minutes) but requires some soaking time. Two of the dishes use kombu dashi, this is very easy to make but requires some forward planning: put a piece of kombu of about 10 x 10 cm into about 500 ml water and put it in the fridge overnight.  Japanese-style  vegan  gluten-free  45-minutes  • 825 kcal per person   I have written out the recipese for each dish separately, in the order in which I prepared them. The hijiki and shiitake need to be soaked for one hour, and the rice needs an hour in total before cooking as well. After this hour soaking time you can just prepare them in order, or if you want it to be a little bit quicker, you can start the rice and the iridofu when you’ve set the hijiki to simmer. This is another very typical Japanese dish called hourenso no ohitashi (ほうれん草のお浸し), you can find the original recipe at Just One Cookbook and a very quick and easy variant at Just Bento. It is and very easy to make if you have the dashi ready. The preparation time is about 5 minutes but it has to marinate for at least 30 minutes after that so it is not actually quick. For two people: Main ingredients: 1 pack of spinach (200 g) Seasonings half a cup cup dashi 1 tablespoon mirin 1 tablespoon soy sauce Main ingredients: 1 pack of spinach (200 g) Main ingredients: 1 pack of spinach (200 g) 1 pack of spinach (200 g) Seasonings half a cup cup dashi 1 tablespoon mirin 1 tablespoon soy sauce Seasonings half a cup cup dashi 1 tablespoon mirin 1 tablespoon soy sauce half a cup cup dashi 1 tablespoon mirin 1 tablespoon soy sauce Mix the dashi, mirin and soy sauce. Put the spinach in the microwave for 1 minute or at most 90 seconds, so that it is just fully wilted. Rinse under cold water to cool. Then squeeze the juice out of the spinach with your hands and create “logs” of about 10 cm long and 3-4 cm wide. Cut the “logs” into pieces of 2-3 cm and put them in a shallow bowl. Pour over the dashi mixture and let marinate for at least half an hour. Mix the dashi, mirin and soy sauce. Put the spinach in the microwave for 1 minute or at most 90 seconds, so that it is just fully wilted. Rinse under cold water to cool. Then squeeze the juice out of the spinach with your hands and create “logs” of about 10 cm long and 3-4 cm wide. Cut the “logs” into pieces of 2-3 cm and put them in a shallow bowl. Pour over the dashi mixture and let marinate for at least half an hour. By the time the other dishes are prepared it will be ready to eat. This way to prepare hijiki seaweed is a very common in Japan, and you can find the original recipe for example at Just Bento or at Just One Cookbook. My variation is to add some ginger and use vegan kombudashi rather than the katsuodashi common in Japan. For two people: Main ingredients: 3-4 tablespoons hijiki seaweed 1 large carrot or 2 small ones 2-3 thin slices from a block of hard tofu, about 50 g (more if you want it to be more filling) Other ingredients: 1 cm ginger, sliced thinly 1 cup kombudashi enough kaeshi for 1 cup dashi: 2 tablespoons mirin 1 tablespoon sugar 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 teaspoon sesame oil 1 tablespoon olive oil (any other oil for frying is fine) Main ingredients: 3-4 tablespoons hijiki seaweed 1 large carrot or 2 small ones 2-3 thin slices from a block of hard tofu, about 50 g (more if you want it to be more filling) Main ingredients: 3-4 tablespoons hijiki seaweed 1 large carrot or 2 small ones 2-3 thin slices from a block of hard tofu, about 50 g (more if you want it to be more filling) 3-4 tablespoons hijiki seaweed 1 large carrot or 2 small ones 2-3 thin slices from a block of hard tofu, about 50 g (more if you want it to be more filling) Other ingredients: 1 cm ginger, sliced thinly 1 cup kombudashi enough kaeshi for 1 cup dashi: 2 tablespoons mirin 1 tablespoon sugar 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 teaspoon sesame oil 1 tablespoon olive oil (any other oil for frying is fine) Other ingredients: 1 cm ginger, sliced thinly 1 cup kombudashi enough kaeshi for 1 cup dashi: 2 tablespoons mirin 1 tablespoon sugar 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 teaspoon sesame oil 1 tablespoon olive oil (any other oil for frying is fine) 1 cm ginger, sliced thinly 1 cup kombudashi enough kaeshi for 1 cup dashi: 2 tablespoons mirin 1 tablespoon sugar 2 tablespoons soy sauce 2 tablespoons mirin 1 tablespoon sugar 2 tablespoons soy sauce 2 tablespoons mirin 1 tablespoon sugar 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 teaspoon sesame oil 1 tablespoon olive oil (any other oil for frying is fine) Soak the hijiki for at least an hour in cold water. While the hijiki is soaking: Cut the tofu into thin strips and put it in the microwave for 2 minutes at full power (900W). Cut the carrots in small strips. Heat the olive oil and sesame oil. Fry the tofu, carrots and ginger until the tofu just starts to brown. Add the soaked hijiki and fry some more. Add the dashi and kaeshi and simmer over low heat for 20-30 minutes until the carrots are tender. Soak the hijiki for at least an hour in cold water.

Add the dashi and kaeshi and simmer over low heat for 20-30 minutes until the carrots are tender. While it’s simmering, you cand start cooking the rice and the iridofu. The final and most substantial dish in this meal is iridoufu (炒り豆腐), another very common dish. It is quite easy and quick to make, in about 15 minutes. The original recipe is from Just Bento. For two people: Main ingredients: 1 block of firm tofu 200-250 g a bunch of chives (abour half a cup chopped) 4 dried shiitake mushrooms, soaked in hot water for at least an hour. You will need 4 tablespoons of the soaking liquid as well. Seasonings 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh ginger 1 tablespoon sesame seeds 2 tablespoons miso 1 tablespoon soy sauce (optional) 1 tablespoon sesame oil 1 tablespoon olive oil Main ingredients: 1 block of firm tofu 200-250 g a bunch of chives (abour half a cup chopped) 4 dried shiitake mushrooms, soaked in hot water for at least an hour.

Heat the oil and fry the ginger and the sesame seeds, then add the chives and mushrooms and fry over medium heat for 30 seconds. Add the tofu to the pan, crumble it with your hands or with a spatula. Fry for a few minutes over low heat, then lower the heat and let simmer. Meanwhile, mix 4 tablespoons of the shiitake soaking liquid with the miso and the soy sauce (optional as it mainly makes the dish a bit more salty). Add the mixture to the pan and fry over medium heat until the liquid has completely gone. Cut the tofu into pieces and put it in the microwave for 3 minutes at full power (900W).

Add the mixture to the pan and fry over medium heat until the liquid has completely gone. The dishes are complemented with plain Japanese rice. For two people: 1 cup of Japanese rice 1 cup of Japanese rice Use 1.1 cup water for 1 cup rice. The cup I use is 200 ml. I wash the rice a few times to get rid of dust and also of the rice flour from polishing. For Japanese rice, you should not just rinse it but also actually “wash” the rice by gently rubbing the grains together between your fingers. A detailed explanation can be found at Makiko Itoh’s site Just Hungry. To cook the 1 cup of rice in the microwave: Put the rice with the water in a microwave-compatible pot with a lid Cook at full power (900W) for one and a half minutes Cook at reduced power (40%, 360W) for 15 minutes.

Thirteen of these tallest statues are in Japan and twelve of these are Kannon statues (the other is a statue of the Buddha). So who is this Kannon, and why are some many of the tall statues of it, in particular in Japan? First of all, there is little mystery in the tall statues themselves. They are almost invariably built either as tourist attractions or as war memorials. What is more interesting though is why so many of them represent the Kannon. Buddha and Bodhisattva Buddhism originated in India sometime between the sixth and fourth century BCE, and spread to Japan via China in the first half of the sixth century CE. By that time, it had already developed a long tradition and forked into several branches. There are three major schools of Buddhism: Theravada, Mahāyāna, and Vajrayana. In general in Buddhism, a bodhisattva (a sentient being, sattva , that develops enlightenment, bodhi) is any person who is on the path towards Buddhahood. Specifically in Mahāyāna Buddhism, a bodhisattva refers to anyone who has developed a mind that strives toward awakening (attaining Buddhahood), empathy, and compassion for the benefit of all sentient beings. (This is known as bodhicitta.) Kannon In Japanese, bodhisattva are know as bosatsu (菩薩). One bosatsu that is especially popular is Kannon (観音). The word is a contraction of Kanzeon (観世音), which in its turn is the most commonly used translation of the bodhisattva known in Sanskrit as Avalokiteśvara. Kannon is the bodhisattva associated with compassion. The name means “[The One Who] Perceives (観) the Sounds (音) of the World (世).” The Sanskrit term was originally Avalokitasvara with the ending svara (“sound, noise”), which means “sound perceiver”, literally “he who looks down upon sound” (i.e., the cries of sentient beings who need his help). Over time, the name changed to Avalokiteśvara. The ending īśvara means “lord”, so the meaning became “lord who gazes down (at the world)”, but articles/kannon retains the original meaning. This bodhisattva is also referred to as Padmapāṇi (“Holder of the Lotus”) or Lokeśvara (“Lord of the World”). In Tibetan, Avalokiteśvara is known as Chenrézig and the Dalai Lama is considered the reincarnation of Chenrézig. In summary, Kannon is the bodhisattva of infinite compassion who gazes down at the human world, hears all the cries of suffering, and works tirelessly to help those who call upon its name. The gender of Kannon is rather vague (I will explain that below) so in what follows I will use the pronouns “they/them” to refer to Kannon. Buddhism in Japan Outside of Japan, Japanese Buddhism is usually associated with Zen Buddhism, but there are many different Buddhist sects in Japan, and Zen sects are actually a minority. This Tofugu article gives a good overview. The dominant form of Buddhism in Japan is Mahāyāna: of the main thirteen sects, eleven are Mahāyāna, including the three Zen sects; only the Ritsu (Theravāda) and Shingon (Vajrayana) sects are not Mahāyāna. In Mahāyāna (and Vajrayana) Buddhism, several Buddhas are venerated that are not found in early Buddhism or in Theravada Buddhism. They are considered to be living in other realms, known as “Pure Lands” (Jōdo 浄土), and are sometimes called “celestial Buddhas” as they are not of this earth. The most important of these is Amitābha (Amida 阿弥陀, “Buddha of Infinite Light”). This is the principal deity of worship for the Pure Land Buddhist sect and sects that derive from this tradition. Kannon is a spiritual emanation of Amida Buddha and therefore occupies a major place in the pantheon. Kannon is mentioned in numerous Mahāyāna sutra (religious texts), but especially in Chapter 25 of the Lotus Sutra (Hokekyō 法華経). Because they are the bodhisattva of of infinite compassion, they became the favourite deity. Today, Kannon worship is very widespread and essentially non-denominational. Their statues are everywhere, and there are hundreds of pilgrimage routes. Gender The Lotus Sutra describes Avalokiteśvara (Kannon) as a bodhisattva who can take the form of any type of god, any type of Buddha, as well as any gender, adult or child, human or non-human being, in order to teach the Dharma to sentient beings. Avalokiteśvara was originally depicted as a male bodhisattva and sometimes even has a light moustache. Although this depiction still exists, in modern times Kannon is more often depicted as a woman or as an androgynous figure. According to the doctrines of the Mahāyāna sūtras themselves, it does not matter whether Kannon is male, female, or genderless, as the ultimate reality is in emptiness (kū 空, śūnyatā). Manifestations A total of 33 different manifestations of Kannon are described in Chapter 25 of the Lotus Sutra depending on whatever a living being needs to be saved. One might think that 33 different forms would be plenty. However, when we look at the Kannon statues, we find that some are indeed part of these 33: The Byakue Kannon (白衣観音, White-robed Kannon), “A persistent femininity clings to this kannon even though the figure is shown as a male.” The Ryōzen Kannon 霊山観音 of Kyoto, a Byakue Kannon. Guze (救世 , salvation or Shou 聖, holy), a male Kannon. The most famous Guze Kannon statue can be found in the Hōryū-ji Temple (法隆寺) in Nara. It was made in the image of prince Shōtoku Taishi (聖徳太子), the first great patron of Buddhism in Japan, in the early 7th Century. Many statues are copies of this one. Gyouran (魚籃, Kannon carrying a fish basket), a female Kannon. There is an interesting story about this kannon (and the same story as a comic) and another nice one.

Despite not being in the canon, this is a very popular Kannon. The Jibō Daikannon of Aizu. Heiwa Kannon (平和 eternal piece), usually male or androgynous, to to pray for world peace and commemorate the war dead. Most of these were built in the 1950s but an interesting example from 1997 is the Awaji Heiwa Kannon. Some of the Kannon dedicated to world piece are Byakue, like the Ryōzen Kannon above and the Ofuna Kannon in Kamakura. Maria Kannon (マリア観音, Virgin Mary), a female Kannon. Christianity was banned in Japan during the Tokugawa Era (1615-1867). In the 17th century, the Japanese crypto-Christians created statues of the Virgin Mary disguised as Kannon. These effigies, called Maria Kannon, looked like Jibō Kannon but they were venerated by the Christians silently praying to Mother Mary. Many of the statues had a Christian icon hidden inside the body or in the artwork.

You may think, well, that’s easy, it’s about cooking and food and Japan. But that is true for many Japanese novels; also, when I first read it, I was not as much into Japan or into food as I am today. I read this novel first in 1997 or so, in any case a few years after the English translation came out in 1993. I borrowed it from the library in Gent, where I was living at the time. When I moved to Scotland, I bought the paperback and that is when it became my favourite. My edition, the UK edition from faber and faber, 2001, has a very simple cover: just a uniform deep pink with the large Japanese characters 台所, and in a thin, wide-kerning sans-serif font “articles/kitchen”. The word 台所 (daidokoro) means kitchen in Japanese². It’s a small and thin book containing the short novel Kitchen and the novella Moonlight Shadow, 150 pages in total. So what makes Kitchen so special for me? I could of course point to the sales figures (in Japan, it was reprinted sixty times and sold millions of copies; it was translated into more than twenty-five languages) and accolades (several literary prizes), or the many scholarly articles and dissertations that have been written about it (some of which I have read with interest) but I didn’t know about all that until later. The reason it was translated at all was of course because it was such a best seller in Japan. It is a book that has always comforted me. The main topics are about dealing with loss and grieving and being alone in the world. Nevertheless, the story is never depressing (it’s also about love). It’s a slice-of-life novel so the plot is not important, and when summarised does amount to very little. But what really makes it my favourite is the writing and in particular the imagery used. The English translation made a deep impression on me. I think that what I like is how the protagonist observes the world, nature and people, and puts it into words. There is a lot of images of light and darkness, which I like in particular. It is very poetic, but at the same time casual as well. Banana Yoshimoto’s writing manages to make the most banal and everyday scenes beautiful. The translation by Megan Backus has been variously criticised (for not being true to the original; for being too literal; for being sentimental,… ) and praised (for being true to the original, for being poetic and beautiful). I have now finally read the novel in Japanese, and it was a wonderful experience. Unsurprisingly, I think the Japanese version is better than the translation. Banana Yoshimoto’s writing is very special, and very difficult to translate (even more so than for example Yoko Ogawa, who also writes very beautiful Japanese). The language in Kitchen is strongly influenced by shoujo manga (Japanese comics for adolescent girls and young adult women), and therefore a combination of very casual language and literary and poetic language; also, Banana Yoshimoto uses many grammatical constructions that don’t translate easily into English. Japanese typically has a topic/comment structure rather than subject-verb-object, but in many cases sentences can be rearranged to match the English structure more closely; Banana Yoshimoto’s writing style makes that harder. Nevertheless, even though it is not flawless (because of course I now notice the flaws), I still love the translated version. I have read other works by Banana Yoshimoto in translation (Lizard, N.P., Goodbye Tsugumi, all translated by Ann Sherif; Asleep, translated by Michael Emmerich); of those, I have read Lizard in Japanese as well. And I would say that in the end it does not really matter: all translations will be different, but in the hands of a competent translator, the voice the original author will be mostly preserved. As an experiment, I tried to translate a short passage from Kitchen myself. The context: Mikage, the young woman who is the narrator of the story, is on a work trip and has gone out late to find something to eat because she’s starving. While waiting for her food, she phones her friend Yuichi, who is also on a trip and, it turns out, is also very hungry. When she tastes the delicious food (katsudon), she decides to order a takeaway meal and take it to him, by taxi — a ride of many hours. When she gets there, in the middle of the night, the ryokan where Yuichi is staying is closed, so she scales the wall of the building to his room is, a dangerous climb which she only manages with great difficulty. My translation: I dropped my backpack at my side and, lying face-up looking up towards the roof of the ryokan, I gazed at the bright moon and clouds and got thinking. (I thought, really, how could I be thinking of this kind of things in such a situation? It was rather a desperate one after all. But I’d like to be called a philosopher in action.) People all think that there are many roads and that we can choose them for ourselves. It’s probably closer to say that we dream of the moment of choice. It was like that for me. But there and then, I knew. I knew so that I could put it clearly into words: although by no means in a fatalistic sense, the road has always been decided. Every day’s breath, every look, repeated day after day, is spontaneously decided. And so in my case, before I realised, as if it was the most natural thing in the world, my katsudon and I had to be lying flat in a puddle on a roof in a strange place in the middle of winter, looking up at the night sky. —Ah, the moon was so beautiful! I got up and knocked on the window of Yuichi’s room. From the official translation by Megan Backus: I shrugged off my pack. Lying there on my back, I looked up at the roof of the inn and, staring at the glowing moon and clouds, I thought, really, we’re all in the same position. (It occurred to me that I had often thought that in similar situations, in moments of utter desperation. I would like to be known as an action philosopher.) We all believe we can choose our own path from among the many alternatives. But perhaps it’s more accurate to say that we make the choice unconsciously. I think I did – but now I knew it, because now I was able to put it into words. But I don’t mean this in the fatalistic sense; we’re constantly making choices. With the breaths we take every day, with the expression in our eyes, with the daily actions we do over and over, we decide as though by instinct. And so some of us will inevitably find ourselves rolling around in a puddle on some roof in a strange place with a takeout katsudon in the middle of winter, looking up at the night sky, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Ah, but the moon was lovely. I stood up and knocked on Yuichi’s window.

The paperback version consists of 6 volumes (2 for each Book), 2,057 pages in total. At the end of June 2020, I finally finished the book. I had started learning Japanese in early 2011 in preparation for a research trip. Unfortunately because of the tsunami and the nuclear disaster the trip didn’t go ahead. But I did go to Japan for two months in the summer of 2012 and again in the summer of 2014. So I had been learning Japanese for about four years and had four months of a more or less immersive experience before I started on the book. However, I had been learning Japanese in a rather haphazard, not very systematic way, because I felt it was more fun that way. Nevertheless, I had put in a considerable amount of time and effort. I took some group lessons but they did not continue beyond the very basics. Then I took one-to-one lessons with a Japanese teacher, which was a much better way to learn. The lessons focused on conversation and grammar but we didn’t cover kanji. I started learning kanji using several apps. The one I’ve been using most consistently is Memrise, to study the meanings of the Jouyou kanji. I don’t like mnemonics-based methods like Heisig’s, and I’ve paid the price for that, because apparently with that method you can learn all readings and meanings for all 2,136 Jouyou kanji in a few months. Whereas all these years later, I still have to practise every day. So, what did I learn through reading Murakami? Despite what others may say, I learned that reading Murakami is hard. Initially, a page took me more than half an hour. Now, after six years, it takes me about five minutes, but that is still much lower than my English reading speed: reading the same passage in English only takes a minute. Arguably Murakami’s writing style is comparatively straightforward, and personally I had (even) more difficulty reading Banana Yoshimoto’s “Tokage” than 1Q84, but that doesn’t mean that I found Murakami easy. But I determined, despite that or because of it, not to give up. I kept going, a few pages at a time. Eventually I got there. I found that reading with a dictionary and looking up the readings and meanings of any character or word I didn’t know is not only wonderfully engaging but also really works as a way to learn Japanese. My reading skills have improved dramatically, and so have my vocabulary and my grasp of grammar. As a result, my writing, listing and speaking skills have also improved. So on the whole, I would recommend reading a Japanese novel as a way of learning Japanese, if you are not in a hurry. On the other hand, I also learned I still have so much to learn. I still don’t know all readings for the Jouyou kanji, and keep forgetting the meanings. I still struggle with conversation (although that may partly be as a result of my tendency of overcomplicating things and wanting to be too precise) and with handwriting. I started handwriting practice in 2018. It requires a better understanding of the structure of the kanji, but it is fun and my recall is improving. I still have a long way to go before I’ll be able to write all Jouyou kanji. I have written down some of my observations before: Reading Murakami in Japanese, Some tips for reading Japanese as a learner, My journey of learning Japanese. One specific thing I started noticing only when reading the last two volumes of 1Q84 is that, when I see a word and I think I can’t pronounce it, often it turns out I can after all, if I just make a little more effort, a kind of mental jump into the unknown. There is a wonderful Japanese expression for this: Kiyomizu no butai kara tobioriru 清水の舞台から飛び降りる (きよみずのぶたいからとびおりる) which literally translates as “to jump off the platform of the Kiyomizu-dera temple”, but means “to make a leap into the dark”. (The platform of the beautiful and ancient Kiyomizu-dera temple in Kyoto offers great views but is also twelve metres high, so jumping off it may not be a good idea.) Recall is sometimes more about daring rather than about remembering: rather than going for conscious recall, trust your unconscious mind to pick the right reading. You actually remember more than you think you remember. You may wonder: having spent nearly six years reading it, do I think it is a good book? I do. It was certainly for the most part entertaining and interesting. I have written three posts about various remarkable points in the book (Repetition in Murakami’s 1Q84, Why the ‘Little People’ say ‘Ho ho’, and Cold or not: a riddle in Murakami’s 1Q84). Are there aspects I don’t like? Yes. The ending leaves me wanting to know what happened to the other characters. Also, there is a bit too much repetition, which I think is a consequence of the book being published in three parts, and in every part Murakami (or his publisher) has felt it necessary to provide sufficient background on what happened before so that each part can be read on its own. There are some parts that I found a bit slow, because I was impatient to get back to the plot, but usually even these parts were actually quite interesting. And finally, will I ever re-read it? Maybe, if my Japanese reading speed ever gets close to my English one.

I had always been very interested in Japan, so this was a great opportunity. I started planning a research visit, and at that point I thought it would be better to learn some Japanese. So about three months before the trip I started my first Japanese lesson. Fortunately, nobody told me one should not attempt to learn a new language over the age of forty. And anyone who has learned some Japanese will appreciate how ridiculously short a time three months is; luckily I didn’t know any better. In any case, I started learning very basic Japanese and I loved it: the writing system, the grammar, the culture as expressed through the language. Learning your first kanji (Chinese characters used in Japanese) is a great experience, because kanji are mysterious, beautiful and concise – and you think you can see the logic to it. And learning the first phrases makes you feel it won’t be all that hard. It’s wonderful. Because of the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, I had to postpone my trip. But in the summer of 2012, having learned Japanese for a bit more than a year, I went to Kyoto for a two-month research visit. And it was amazing: kanji everywhere! Somewhere along the path, learning Japanese had become a goal in its own right, not just a practical tool for survival in the wild. It was that as well, of course – just try shopping in a Japanese supermarket without knowing any Japanese. So I conversed in broken Japanese, and looked up kanji on my phone (and was surprised how many signs said “dentist”), and tried to improve my hiragana and katakana reading skills. I didn’t actively study, the total immersion was all I wanted. At that time I had learned only basic grammar and sentence structure, very little informal Japanese – my teacher does not hold with that – and about 100 of the 500 most frequent kanji. I quickly discovered that “most frequent” does not really mean “common” or vice versa. The “most frequent kanji” list is based on newspaper articles, so there are many common kanji that are not in that list. Also, “knowing” or “having learned” a kanji is a rather vague term, and being able to tick them off in a spaced repetition app like Anki or Memrise (great tools though they are!) does not mean you know the meaning of a word consisting of “known” kanji, let alone its pronunciation. Kanji typically have several meanings, sometimes wildly different (e.g. 洗　means both “wash” and “inquire into”) and several readings, some based on the original Chinese pronunciation of the character, some on the Japanese pronunciation of the meaning of the character (e.g. 明日 “tomorrow” can be read as “ashita”, “asu” or “myonichi”). So there is a lot to learn. By now I was hooked, by both the language and the country. Two more years of study later I visited Japan again. On that visit I bought the paperback version of Haruki Murakami’s “1Q84”. It comes in 6 volumes, each about 400 pages. I started reading it on my return (October 2014). It is a slow process because really my Japanese is by far not good enough. I continuously encounter kanji that I have not learned yet or already forgotten, so I have to look them up. Luckily I can do this on my phone, by writing them stroke by stroke. It is now April 2016 and I have reached page 295 (of 357) in the first volume. At this rate, it will take me another 15 years to finish the book. This may not seem very encouraging. However, I hope of course that my reading skills will improve. And in fact I have found reading this way to be more enjoyable than reading the book in English translation: reading Japanese requires a deeper concentration and I feel more immersed in the story – and I find the Japanese writing simply beautiful. The books have also inspired me to make a few “Murakami meals”, which I’ll be posting soon. Speaking of food, I also bought a Zen temple cuisine cookbook, available in Japanese only. It gives a unique insight in the Zen way of cooking – and the language and vocabulary are much easier than Murakami’s. I’d like to thank my teacher Rie Ogura for her patience with me, waiting endlessly while I fumble for the right words.

I knew that at funerals and memorial services, the monks chant Buddhist text in bongo (梵語), a Japanese transliteration of Sanskrit. The practice is known as shōmyō (声明) and a text that is often chanted is called shichi (四智), “the Four Wisdoms”, or shichibongo (四智梵語) in full. The Four Wisdoms text in Japanese Traditionally, shōmyō texts are written using specific and quite unusual Chinese characters, but they are used purely for their phonetic value, not for their meaning. Here is the text in full, from the site of the Buzan sect of Shingon Buddhism. It also has a recording of the chanting. The same text with only very minor differences is used also by the sects of Tendai Buddhism, but I focus here on Shingon only for convenience. The word shingon (真言, lit. “True Words”) is the translation of the Sanskrit word Mantra. From the Japanese text to the original Sanskrit I found the kanji and katakana for this text in a Japanese academic paper on the meaning of the shichibongo: 四智梵語 オム　バザラ　サトバ　ソギャラカ 唵　　嚩日囉　薩怛嚩　蘇蘗　囉賀 バザラ　アラタンノウ　マドタラン 嚩日囉　囉　怛　曩　　摩覩怛覧 バザラ　タラマ　キャヤタイ 嚩日囉　達　麽　誐　夜那 バザラ　キャラマ　キャロ　ハムバ 嚩日囉　羯　　磨　迦　嚕　婆　縛 This transliterates in romaji as: shichibongo om bazara-satoba sogyaraka bazara-aratannou madotaran bazara-tarama kyayatai bazara-kyarama kyaro hamba The same paper also gave the original Sanskrit phrasing, transliterated in the roman alphabet: oṃ vajrasattva samgrahād vajraratnam anuttaraṃ vajradharma gāyanair vajrakarma karo bhava What does the Sanskrit text say? The Sanskrit version allowed me to search for a translation. I found one in a book on Japanese music that discussed shōmyō: Oṃ. Receiving the blessing of the wisdom of Vajra-sattva, we obtain the ultimate vajra-ratna. By chanting the vajra-dharma, we may attain the vajra-karma of enlightenment. I am not familiar with esoteric Buddhism so I found this translation hard to understand. I therefore looked a bit further into this. Some background on esoteric Buddhism First, we need to know about Vajrayana, also know as Esoteric Buddhism, the Buddhist tradition of which Shingon Buddhism is a branch. According to the according to the Encyclopaedia Britannica: Vajrayana, (Sanskrit: “Diamond Vehicle” or “Thunderbolt Vehicle”) form of Tantric Buddhism that developed in India and neighbouring countries, notably Tibet. Vajrayana, in the history of Buddhism, marks the transition from Mahayana speculative thought to the enactment of Buddhist ideas in individual life. The term vajra (Sanskrit: “diamond” or “thunderbolt” ) is used to signify the absolutely real and indestructible in a human being, as opposed to the fictions an individual entertains about himself and his nature; yana is the spiritual pursuit of the ultimately valuable and indestructible. And further: Vajrayana first emerged in various parts of India and Sri Lanka. The esoteric nature of Tantric doctrine and practice makes identifying the origins of the Vajrayana school difficult, but some Buddhist traditions associate them with Nagarjuna and Asanga and therefore suggest that Vajrayana began to develop quietly in the 2nd or 4th century CE. Vajrayana was prominent in India and Tibet, and a form of it spread to China and then to Japan, where it became associated with the Tendai and Shingon schools. Then, we need to know about the concept of the mandala. Again according to the Encyclopaedia Britannica: Mandala, (Sanskrit: “circle”) in Hindu and Buddhist Tantrism, a symbolic diagram used in the performance of sacred rites and as an instrument of meditation. The mandala is basically a representation of the universe, a consecrated area that serves as a receptacle for the gods and as a collection point of universal forces. The Mandala of the Diamond Realm Shingon Buddhism makes frequent use of two mandalas, the Mandala of the Womb Realm and the Mandala of the Diamond Realm (Kongōkai Mandala, 金剛界 曼荼羅). kongō (金剛) means “diamond” or “adamant, and is a translation of the Sanskrit “vajra”. These realms and their composition are based on an esoteric Buddhist sutra called the Vajrasekhara Sutra. The Diamond Realm (金剛界 Kongōkai) is a metaphysical space inhabited by the Five Wisdom Buddhas. In Shingon Buddhism, there is a group of deities, known as the Vajra Bodhisattva. The “Four Wisdoms” refers to the four Vajra Bodhisattva that surround Dainichi Nyorai in the Shiin-e (四印会) section of the Kongōkai Mandala. The Dainichi Nyorai (大日如来) is the Buddha in the highest form of existence, dharmakaya, hosshin (法身) in Japanese. Finally, back to the Four Wisdoms Thus the Four Wisdoms of the text refer to these four Vajra Bodhisattva: Kongōsatta 金剛薩埵 ( Vajra-sattva, “diamond being”) Kongōhō 金剛宝 ( Vajra-ratna, “diamond treasure”) Kongōhō 金剛法 ( Vajra-dharma, “diamond law”) Kongōgyō 金剛業 ( Vadra-karma, “diamond action” ). Kongōsatta 金剛薩埵 ( Vajra-sattva, “diamond being”) Kongōhō 金剛宝 ( Vajra-ratna, “diamond treasure”) Kongōhō 金剛法 ( Vajra-dharma, “diamond law”) Kongōgyō 金剛業 ( Vadra-karma, “diamond action” ). According to the explanation on the site of the Buzan sect, these four bodhisattva are identified with the four wisdom buddha surrounding Dainichi Nyorai in the Five Wisdom Buddhas: “The Four Wisdoms represents the wisdom of the four Wisdom Buddhas, and by making offerings to each other, the Four Wisdoms represent the entire mandala of Vajrayana, with Dainichi Nyorai in the center.” The banner picture is of the Great Buddha of Kamakura.

The focus of this post is on how I’m learning and what tools I’ve been using. I think that the most important factor in learning Japanese is not to give up, to keep working at it steadily, even if it’s only a few minutes every day. This is probably true for learning any language, but I think more so for Japanese because of the need to learn kanji. When I started (in 2011), I used JapanesePod101, and I really think that for absolute beginners it is a very good way to start. I listened to the podcasts on my way to work and found that quite effective. The audio lessons also come with written material covering vocabulary and grammar and the JapanesePod101 YouTube channel has a very large collection of videos. Apart from that I also used Tae Kim’s Guide to Learning Japanese, especially the grammar guide. I learned this way for about a year, but then I decided I wanted to focus more on reading and less on listening, so I started learning kanji. (To practise conversation I get a two-hour lesson with a Japanese teacher every two weeks.) I try to do at least 5 minutes of kanji practice per day. That really isn’t much, and yet it was sufficient to learn the 2,000 common use (Jouyou,常用) kanji in about four years. As I wrote in my earlier post, by summer 2012 I only knew about 100 kanji, and I finished the Jouyou series before the start of last summer. I still do my daily kanji practice because unless I revise I easily forget them. I have an Android phone, and initially I used Anki, then Simple Kanji Quiz, but I felt that I made most progress when I started using Memrise. I still use Simple Kanji Quiz because it is very configurable but what I like about Memrise is its goalsetting. It’s quite rewarding to reach your daily goal after five minutes! I looked at WaniKani as well because I love Tofugu, but WaniKani only works if you start from scratch so by the time it came out I had already learned most of the basic kanji. I have thought quite a lot about the best ways to learn but in the end I’ve decided not to be very systematic. For example, my Memrise deck only tests if I know the meaning of a kanji, not its on and kun readings. I have set up my Simple Kanji Quiz to practise readings both ways. So for a given kanji I’m either practising meaning or reading but not both at the same time. My only kanji handwriting practice is looking up kanji on my phone (I use Kanji Draw but the Japanese app is also very good). Handwriting kanji on paper takes a lot of time, and unless you live in Japan I don’t think it is an essential skill. To expand my vocabulary my main approach is reading. I also sometimes listen to podcasts or Japanese music, or watch anime or Japanese movies, and of course I should learn new words while talking to my teacher. But I don’t really spend time in memorising new words, I just let it happen. I found that encountering words in different contexts is a great way to learn. For example, a few days ago I read the word でかい (huge) in a blog post, and then I heard it used in the anime Spirited Away. Now I’m pretty sure I will remember this word.　 But what really works best for me to build vocabulary is to go to Japan, so of course I would strongly recommend that. The constant immersion works wonders. Many words I remember because I see in my mind the situation where I first encountered them.　 Fuss-free food Updated December 22, 2017 About Blog Terms About Blog Terms © 2024   Jekyll theme Skinny Bones","tags":"","url":"more-on-articles/learning-japanese/index.html"}, {"title":"Per Tiziana","text":" Per Tiziana Eidon wrote a beautiful short piece called “per Tiziana”, with two different arrangements. Listening to these two quite different versions, I wondered if I could make a third arrangement. This is again a twin post, the other version is on Eidon’s blog. Eidon says: “Conjure is an interesting word. It comes from Latin, from “cum iurare”, which can be translated back as “command on oath” (late 13c.) or “summon by a sacred name” (c. 1300). Indeed, my experience with composing music is often one of inverted conjuring. Inverted because I do not conjure anything – it is I that am commanded, in fact; and the sacred name, the kotodama if you like that puts me in motion and turns me into its servant, is the music theme that visits me. That is what happened with “Per Tiziana” too. Its theme came to me and made me swear that I would serve her well. In practice, this meant that, for days and days and days, the theme of “Per Tiziana” stayed with me all the time. Although I was doing other things, the background (and often the foreground) thoughts were “per Tiziana”. In retrospective, rather than composing it, I was trying to remember it – reconstruct it… Multiple times I tried to put it down and found myself thinking: “That’s not it”. When I finally got it (to some extent) right, I found that its decoration with other voices would take me much less than I had expected. Flute, vibraphone, alto sax, cellos, pizzicato strings, timpani, drums, and electric guitar were my initial choices. You can listen to the result here. I also produced a second take, only based on piano, timpani, and drums. And yes I was happy with the result! I thought to myself, “This is the track that best represents me thus far”. So much so that, even after the finishing touches, I found myself still “conjured” by this track: I could still not think of anything else but her… But dear friend Wim came to my rescue and released me from my oath! He had liked “Per Tiziana” and told me that he had a new instrumentation in mind. I was very happy of this – Wim has a special gift for instrumentations, and that was also a way to sign my contract off with that piece, in a sense. Oh my god, by any chance did I pass on the conjuring?! I’ve just realized that! Ouch, not so nice of me… And so Wim took over. For some reason, I had expected an instrumentation with classical music instruments, though Wim truly surprised me with something radically different. And I liked it very, very much! The new manifestation truly resonated with me, and I’m very happy of this wonderful present that Wim had for me. Thank you very much, Wim ^__^ When listening to the new instrumentation I realized that I wanted to have an extra final note to the piece. I hope one day we may truly write a piece together from beginning to end: maybe a new piece for our Wim and Eidon album! Wim says: “My original idea was to try and merge both of Eidon’s versions into something new. But when I listened very carefully to both versions, I realised that wouldn’t work. Each in its own way was already complete. So I had to try and create an entirely different arrangement. I started from the original arrangement which as Eidon explained has six voices: vibraphone, two cellos, electric guitar, timpani and drums. Eidon kindly provided the MuseScore files. As Eidon has guessed, my first attempt was an orchestral version, because I am comfortable with that: strings, cellos, bass, a clarinet for the main melody, orchestral percussion. It was easy to do and the result sounds nice enough but it did to my ears not really “work”. One issue is the note duration and range which are not a perfect fit for the string instruments. The other is more fundamental: the complex drum pattern in the second part of the piece simply does not work with a symphonic arrangement. This got me to think about the percussion. Because it is a repetitive pattern, I wondered if it would sound good on a drum machine. For some reason – I guess by association with the band 808 State – I thought specifically of the Roland TR-808. That lead to the idea of using old synthesisers for the other voices as well. I experimented with a few and at a certain point I literally laughed out loud because the combination I hit upon worked so beautifully! I shared a first cut with Eidon and he suggested to bring out one of the voices more. I had also commented on the note duration and he explained that the initial instrument he had chosen was a vibraphone that had large preset values for sustain/reverb. I also was not satisfied with my choice of instrument for the timpani voice, and the volume of the drumset voice. My final arrangement is as follows: polysynth for the lead voice, synth bass 1 and 3, Moog pad, Roland Brightness from RKHive for the timpani and the TR-808 drum machine. I changed made the last note in each phrase of the main melody longer and simplified the electric guitar score a bit so that it sounded more natural for the Moog pad. I kept the percussion volume relatively low. Eidon did a final tweak, adding an extra note to complete the piece, and we’re both very happy with the result. I really enjoy making these alternative arrangements of Eidon’s work, so really it is I who should thank him for creating these wonderful pieces. “ Here is the finished track. We hope you like it!

I came across a traditional dance performance and took some pictures, one of them is the banner for this post. This summer I wanted to make a drawing with a Japanese theme and I selected that picture. Before starting on the drawing, I felt I had to find out more about the dance. Most of what follows is taken from the page about Ryōō 陵王 on the Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System and the Japanese Wikipedia page about Ranryōō (蘭陵王), with some additional information from this New York Public Library blog article. The legend The most common interpretation of the dance is that it celebrates the victory of Prince Lanling (Ranryōō, 蘭陵王) of Pohai (北斉 , Manchuria) over the Zhou dynasty, around 550 A.D. He was a general named Gao Changgong who was given a fiefdom in Lanling, so he was also known as the Prince of Lanling. The Prince of Lan Ling was one of the four most handsome men in ancient Chinese history. A masterful warrior, he led his army into battle and vanquished his foes while wearing a fearsome Ryōō mask to hide his beauty. His most famous battle was the breaking of the siege of Jinyong (金墉, near modern Luoyang) in 564 A.D. Gao Changgong led only 500 cavalrymen and fought through an army of Northern Zhou, which was attacking the city with 100,000 soldiers. He fought his way to the gates the city, surprising the defenders. The soldiers of Jinyong didn’t recognize him, so he took off his helmet and mask. The soldiers in the city rejoiced at his arrival and their courage returned. They opened the gates and joined the battle outside the city. Soon the army of Northern Zhou was defeated. To celebrate the victory, the soldiers composed the famous song and dance “Prince Lanling in Battle” (兰陵王入阵曲). The tradition There are variations on the legend: some say that the prince wore the mask himself to frighten his enemies, others that his father’s ghost appeared wearing the mask. Others trace the dance back to the Eight Dragon Kings (hachidai ryuuou 八大竜王) of the Buddhist Lotus Sutra. Following this latter tradition, folk festivals in Japan since the 13th century often incorporate the dance of Ran-ryou-ou as a rain prayer, as dragons are associated with water. This may partly account for the great popularity of the dance. The dance The dance is called ranryouou nyuujinkyoku (蘭陵王入陣曲) “The song of Prince Lan-Ling going into Battle”. It is a traditional Japanese court dance or bugaku (舞楽) introduced in the Japanese Imperial courts in the 9th century, and performed to traditional Japanese court music or gagaku (雅楽). For much of its history, bugaku was an exclusive and privileged experience, performed only at the Japanese imperial court and, very rarely, as part of religious rituals at temples or shrines. In those days (the Heian era) the imperial court was organized with a strict Left and Right division. In terms of culture, poetry, music and dance, the Left was associated with China or India and the Right with Korea. Costumes for dances of the Left are primarily red. The music, tougaku (唐楽) is a Japanese adaptation of Chinese musical styles prevalent during the T’ang Dynasty. The Ranryōō is a dynamic dance of the Left (sa-no-mai 左舞) and it is originally from either China or Southeast Asia (rin’yuugaku 林邑楽). It is performed by one person dressed in a fringed tunic and pantaloons (ryoutou shouzoku 裲襠装束). The mask or bugakumen (舞楽面) is of a fierce, mythical golden beast with a dragon perched on its head. The mask Although Ranryōō masks can look vary different, they all share a common set of features: a sharp, long nose; bulging, rotating eyes (dougan 動眼); a gaping mouth with huge teeth and dangling chin (tsuriago 吊顎); wrinkles that line the face and the carved strands of heavy hair above the forehead. The golden face and metallic eyes are offset by the blue-green hair and vermilion mouth. There are tufts of animal hair suggestive of eyebrows, a moustache and beard. On the top of the head perches a crouching dragon. I found an interesting blog post (in Japanese) by a Ranryōō dancer, where he compares various masks from his own collection. The drawing I wanted to make a drawing with bright colours and a lot of detail, and also I prefer to draw human figures, but I didn’t want to do a portrait. So this Ranryōō dancer was a perfect match. I replaced the audience with people in yukata (浴衣, a light summer kimono) to make the scene more homogeneous. For most of the yukata designs I used my own pictures but the designs of the central four figures are based on the yukata worn by the sisters in Hirokazu Kore-eda’s wonderful movie “海街 diary” (“Our little sister”). The main focus is of course the dancer, so I drew and coloured the musicians and audience in a much more sketchy way. The paper for this drawing is Arches 56cm x 76cm 300g/m2 “rough” watercolour paper. It’s a really nice paper with a pronounced grain and absorbs the water really well. As I did not tape it on a board, the sheet of course buckled a bit. I used Derwent Inktense and Conté Aquaralle pencils as well as watercolour paint (various brands). The Inktense pencils give a very saturated colour. It was the first time I used them but I really like them. I started the drawing as usual with a pencil ghost drawing. Because of the size of the drawing, I used a grid to make sure the figure was positioned correctly. Then I added a first layer of detail and colour with the watercolour pencils. Next I started to detail and wash the mask. I needed a very fine pencil and a magnifying glass for the eyes. Then I worked on the tunic in the same way. Next I did the trousers, which took a long time, and the sleeves, ending the first full pass of the entire figure. Then I worked on the detail of the yukata of the figures in the background, which I decided to do in indigo blue for all of them. Usually I use a relatively blunt pencil because in general that works better on coarse-grained paper, but to render the patterns on the fabric with very fine lines before washing them I used an extra-sharp pencil. Next I added more detail and colour to the musicians, but I left them quite sketchy on purpose. Then I put a second layer of colour on the dancer, to make the red and orange more vibrant, and make the shadows more pronounced. I used a mixture of watercolour paint and watercolour pencils. Finally I did another pass of the entire drawing. I added more colour to the background figures but made them darker at the same time, as they are actually in the shadow. Adding the shadow layer was tricky because I could not just wash the entire background with a darker tint, as it would make the colours run. Instead, I used a layer of colour pencil. I added still more colour to the dancer, especially to the sleeves, again using a mixture of watercolour paint and watercolour pencils. To finish the drawing I added a description in Japanese, “蘭陵王　雅楽公演　祇園祭”, which means “Ranryoo, public bugaku performance, Gion matsuri”.

(It’s now July 2016 and I’ve finally finished the first volume!) This post is about reading Japanese. I’ll give some tips on how to look up kanji and a few handy rules to simplify the reading process. I haven’t really encountered these tips and rules as such in my learning materials, so I thought they may be of interest to other learners as well. When learning to read in a language that uses an alphabet, you can simply look up any word you don’t know in a dictionary. Because of the use of kanji (漢字, Chinese characters), things are more complicated for the learner of Japanese. Words written in katakana or hiragana (the sets of about fifty characters used to write Japanese phonetically) are easy to look it up. But what to do with kanji? There are about two thousand kanji in general use. Learning them all takes a long time: in the Japanese school system, it takes nine years. Typically each kanji has several possible readings (pronunciation) and meanings. And knowing every meaning of every kanji does not mean knowing the meaning of words that use combinations of kanji. For me, reading for learning is different from ordinary reading. Normally, I read to understand the meaning of a text. When learning Japanese, I also want to learn the readings of the kanji I encounter and I want to practise recall of the kanji and compound words that I’ve already learnt. Usually I make a first pass through a page of the text without looking anything up, trying to remember as much as possible, both readings and meanings, and to guess at readings and meanings of compound words where possible. Very often the context helps to guess at meanings, so I make sure to read enough text to get sufficient context. Then in a second pass I look up every kanji for which I don’t know either the reading or the meaning, and every compound word that I don’t know. I find that the most convenient way to look up a kanji is an electronic dictionary on a smartphone, because I need to know just one of the readings. If I don’t know any of the readings, I use three different ways, depending on the kanji. All of them require understanding of the basics of kanji writing and structure: the stroke order, stroke count and the “radicals”, the kanji building blocks that make up the more complex kanji. The first way is to draw the kanji stroke by stroke. I prefer this approach as a learner, because I tend to remember the kanji better if I’ve had to write it. Typically, a kanji writing app will present a list of kanji that match the handwritten one. If my writing was good, I’ll get the kanji I was looking for on the first page. The second approach is to look up the kanji by radical. Most electronic dictionaries offer that facility. It usually works well if the radicals making up the kanji are clear. It really helps to know how to count the strokes in a radical, because they are usually ordered by stroke count. My final way is to use a (paper) dictionary with the SKIP (System of Kanji Indexing by Patterns) system for ordering kanji. I have the well-known “Kodansha Kanji Learner’s Dictionary”. The SKIP method is based on first classifying the kanji into one of 4 groups (Left-Right ◧, Up-Down ⬒, Enclosure ◻, and Solid ◼). For the first two categories, further indexing is by stroke count of both parts. Kanji in the third category (enclosure) are indexed by the number of sides of the enclosure. Kanji in the last category typically can’t always be broken down, but there aren’t that many of them and most of them are simple kanji. The first way is to draw the kanji stroke by stroke.

Kanji in the last category typically can’t always be broken down, but there aren’t that many of them and most of them are simple kanji. Although the many readings and meanings may sound horribly complicated, I found that there are actually a few general rules that simplify the reading process. Of course there are exceptions to all of these rules but they hold most of the time. Kanji have typically two types of readings, called on (音,”sound”) and kun (訓,”instruction” or “explanation”). The on-reading is based on the sound of the original Chinese reading of a character; the kun-reading is the Japanese word with the same meaning. Chinese used to play a similar role as Latin or Greek in ancient Japan, so in a way on-readings are comparable with words with a Latin or Greek root in English. The first general rule is that kanji appearing on their own (i.e. not in combination with other kanji) have almost always the kun-reading. For example, for the kanji 食, it will be one of the four kun-readings (く.う “ku-u”, く.らう “ku-rau”, た.べる “ta-beru” or は.む “ha-mu”), not one of the on-readings. To select the correct kun-reading, look at the hiragana following the kanji so 食う is pronounced as “kuu” and 食べる is pronounced as “taberu”. The second general rule is that in a compound word, all kanji have either the on- or the kun-reading. And for the vast majority of the compound words, it will be the on-reading. For example, 食事 is shokuji (on-_on_), not “ta-ji” (kun-_on_) or “shoku-koto” (on-_kun_). Generally, there are fewer on-readings than kun-readings for a kanji, and on-readings are also mostly single-syllable. Although there are indeed many on- and kun-readings, for most kanji one of each will be the most frequently used, and the others will likely be used only in fixed combinations. The same is true for meanings: usually one of the meanings is used much more frequently than all the others.

Fuss-free food Updated July 02, 2016 About Blog Terms About Blog Terms © 2024   Jekyll theme Skinny Bones","tags":"","url":"articles/reading-japanese/index.html"}, {"title":"Reading Murakami in Japanese","text":" Reading Murakami in Japanese As mentioned in previous posts, I started reading Murakami’s 1Q84 in Japanese in October 2014, after I had been learning Japanese for about three years. The paperback (bunko, 文庫) edition consists of 6 volumes, two volumes for each of the three Books that make up 1Q84. Each volume is about 400 pages. In July 2016 I finished the first volume. It is now May 2019 and I have finally finished the four volumes comprising Books 1 and 2. At first, my reading speed was very slow, about half an hour per page, because I constantly had to look up kanji and grammar constructs. In the last three years, my reading speed has fortunately improved quite a bit: it takes me now five minutes to read a page in Japanese. However, to read the equivalent English translation takes only one minute, so I still have some way to go. As my reading improved, I started to use different ways of reading. Reading aloud In Japanese, “reading aloud” is called rōdoku (ろうどく, 朗読), a word I quite like because rō means “melodious, clear, bright, serene, cheerful”. Maybe somewhat surprisingly, it turns out that silent reading is a relatively young development: before the 17th century, reading essentially meant reading aloud. I find reading aloud very useful because it helps me to understand the flow of the sentence and I also find it easier to understand the meaning. There are many other benefits to reading aloud, as explained in this article on Voices.com. A small disadvantage is that I can get stuck on any kanji for which I don’t know the pronunciation – I find it hard to continue without looking it up right away in my dictionary. Still, I like to read aloud also because I simply like the sound of Japanese. Reading without vocalising When reading Japanese silently (mokudoku もくどく, 黙読), I usually subvocalise, i.e. I hear the text in my head. However, I found that not doing this has some interesting advantages. I am of course not the first one to make this observation, see e.g. Significance of Silent Reading, but these are my observations for the particular case of reading Japanese as a non-native. For one, I don’t get stuck on unknown kanji readings, so my flow is not broken so easily. Also, it means that I go straight from word shapes to meanings. For example, I do not need to know that 菜食主義者 is pronounced saishokushugisha (さいしょくしゅぎしゃ) to know that it means “vegetarian” (菜 sai is vegetable, 食 shoku is to eat, 主義 shugi is doctrine and 者 sha is person). Even for new words it is often possible to tell the meaning from the kanji – one of the advantages of a writing system based on logograms. When not vocalising, it is not necessary to read every individual character. In Japanese the grammar is usually conveyed using groups of hiragana characters and I find that just geting the overall shape is enough to see if a sequence of characters is a negation, or a polite suffix etc. And finally it allows me to speed-read: I can simply scan the text for kanji that indicate the “interesting” parts. And I can now add speed reading to my vocabulary as well: sokudoku (そくどく, 速読). Further reading Here are some articles for your perusal (jukudoku, じゅくどく, 熟読).

I read the English translation when it was first published but I had never looked up any reviews. The Japanese paperback comes in six volumes and after finishing the third volume*, I decided to check some reviews, and I was somewhat surprised to find that most critics didn’t like the book very much. One of the recurrent criticisms is that the characters repeat one another frequently. This is in particular the case for the conversations between Tengo and Fuka-eri. Murakami mentions that Fuka-eri has dyslexia and based on her behaviour and speech it is likely that she also has autistic spectrum disorder (Murakami describes her speech as monotonous or flat, and she clearly prefers to use single words, although she can speak in full sentences; her facial expression is impossible to read; there are many more hints like this). In Japanese, Murakami uses a specific writing style to express Fuka-eri’s way of speaking. Japanese has three sets of characters: hiragana and katakana which are phonetic alphabets, and Chinese characters (kanji). In general, kanji are used to indicate the meaning of words, hiragana is used to express the grammar and katakana is used for foreign words or as a kind of italics. Japanese has few distinct sounds, there are lots of homonyms, and the kanji disambiguate the meanings for the homonyms. However, katakana and hiragana can be used to phonetically write kanji but sentences without kanji can be difficult to read, especially because no spaces are used between words. Murakami renders Fuka-eri’s speech using hiragana and katakana characters only, without kanji. For example: 「セキブンのはなしはおもしろかった」 「予備校の僕の講義のこと？」 ふかえりは肯いた。 「君は数学は好き？」 ふかえりは短く首を振った。数学は好ではない。 「でも積分の話は面白かったんだ？」と天語は尋ねた。 In the English translation by Jay Rubin, the exchange is: ‘The calculus part was good.’ ‘You mean in my lecture?’ Fuka-eri nodded. ‘Do you like math?’ She gave her head a quick shake. She did not like math. ‘But the part about calculus was good? he asked.’ Even though the translator has changed the wording slightly, the last sentence still mostly repeats the first. When written in roman alphabet, the first and the last sentence of the Japanese dialogue are virtually identical: ‘sekibun no hanashi wa omoshirokatta’ ‘demo sekibun no hanashi wa omoshirokatta?’ However, although the pronunciation is word for word identical, the effect in the original Japanese text is different because the first sentence, said by Fuka-eri, is written only in hiragana and katakana characters, while the last sentence, said by Tengo, uses kanji. For example, while sekibun has only one meaning, the seki in sekibun could mean amongst others “stone” or “seat” or “red”; bun could mean amongst others　”minute”, “sentence” or “mosquito”. Without the kanji it is harder for the reader, and requires more context, to work out the meaning. Furthermore, Japanese has the particular grammar feature of particles (joshi, 助詞). These are suffixes or short words that immediately follow a noun, verb, adjective, or sentence and can act as conjunctions, prepostions or modifiers. Some of these particles are attached at the very end of the sentence to add an emotion or tone, or convey that the sentence is a question. Fuka-eri never uses those sentence-ending particles, and in particular the question marking particle. As her speech is uninflected, and the word order in Japanese is the same for statements and questions, it is not always clear if she is asking a question or just stating something. For example: 「わたしをだきたくない」とふかえりは疑問符抜きで尋ねた。 ‘watashi wo dakitakunai’ to fukaeri wa gimonfunuki de tazuneta. Which Jay Rubin translates as: ‘You don’t want to hold me,’ Fuka-eri asked without a question mark. Because of the lack of question mark or particle, there is no way to know if this is a question or not. A proper Japanese sentence would have been either「私を抱きたくないか」or 「私を抱きたくない？」and indeed, Tengo says: 「君を抱く？」 ‘Hold you?’ The lack of kanji and particles means that Fuka-eri’s sentences in Japanese are often quite ambiguous. So when Tengo repeats Fuka-eri’s sentences, he’s making sure that he understands her correctly, but Murakami also uses this to clarify to the reader what she’s just said. For example, 「イヘンがあろうとしている」 「イヘン」と天吾は言った。それが「異変」であると思い当たるまでに少し時間がかかった。 ‘ihen ga arou toshite iru’ ‘ihen’ to tengo wa itta. sore ga ‘ihen’ de aru to omoiataru made ni sukoshi jikan ga kakatta. The meaning of “ihen” (イヘン) is not clear when written in katakana. In fact, a possible meaning of the sentence could be ‘You’ll have a leather cord’. The Japanese sentence actually says that it takes a while for Tengo to realise that “ihen”,イヘン means ”something unusual”,異変. In the English translation, this becomes ‘That something extra ordinary is starting.’ It took Tengo a moment to realize this meant “extraordinary”. Jay Rubin has left out the sentence ‘ihen’ to tengo wa itta. He could have translated it as ‘Extra ordinary’ said Tengo, but that would have made the exchange even more repetitive. In the Japanese version of 1Q84, the exchanges with Fuka-eri are my favourite parts. Her sentences are very easy to read, except for the lack of kanji; then Tengo’s paraphrasing puts in the kanji as well. So as a learner I get both the reading and the meaning. Another example: 「わたしはここにのこっている」とふかえりは言った。 「君はここに残っている」と天語は反復した。 ‘watashi wa koko ni nokotte iru’ to fukaeri wa itta. ‘kimi wa koko ni nokotte iru’ to tengo wa hanpuku shita. The translation says: ‘I’ll stay here,’ Fuka-eri said. ‘You’ll stay here,’ Tengo echoed her. Again, this looks more repetitive than the original. The English translation of the first two books is by Jay Rubin, who is very renowned for translating Murakami’s works, and I think his translation of 1Q84 is excellent. However, the repetition in the English translation is fundamentally different from the Japanese original because of the writing system. It is impossible to translate the effect of the difference between words writtin in hiragana, katakana and kanji into a language with a single alphabet-based writing system like English.     *After four years of reading.

Kiyomizu-dera Kiyomizu-dera (清水寺) is a famous temple in eastern Kyoto. It sits on a steep hill and its main hall is built on a high wooden platform that offers great views over the city. There is an expression kiyomizu no butai kara tobioriru (清水の舞台から飛び降りる) which translates a “to jump off the stage of the Kiyomizu temple” and means “to make a leap into the dark, to jump in at the deep end”. In the olden days, (presumably rather desperate) people would jump off the platform of the Kannon hall of the temple in the belief that, if they got off scot-free, their wishes would be granted, and if they died they would enter Nirvana. The drop is thirteen metres. Records from the Edo era show that 234 people jumped off the platform; 34 of them died. In 1872, the Kyoto city council issued an order forbidding this practice. The Kannon with the Thousand Arms and Thousand Eyes Kiyomizu-dera is a Buddhist temple and is dedicated to Kannon (観音, kan-on), the bodhisattva of infinite compassion. I wrote a previous post about this deity, “The mystery of the giant Kannon statues”. The manifestation of Kannon worshipped in Kiyomizu-dera is the Thousand-armed Kannon (senju articles/kannon, 千手観音), one of the most popular manifestations: the thousand arms symbolizes Kannon’s ability to embrace and alleviate the suffering of the world. In full it is the “Kannon with a Thousand Arms and a Thousand Eyes”, every hand holds an eye. People prayed to the Senju Kannon to avoid illness, eye problems, and blindness. The Blue Dragon In traditional Chinese astronomy, there are four mythological creatures that guard the four cardinal directions. They are the Blue Dragon of the East, the Vermilion Bird of the South, the White Tiger of the West, and the Black Tortoise of the North. In Japan these creatures are considered the guardian spirits of cities. So the Blue Dragon (seiryū, 青龍) protects the city of Kyoto on the east and Kiyomizu-dera is dedicated to it. The Kiyomizu-dera temple legend says that the Kannon is incarnated as the Blue Dragon. The temple is built on the site of the Otowa waterfall (音羽の瀧) and according to the legend, every night the dragon comes flying to drink from the water. The drawing In March and September there is a procession called the seiryū-e (青龍会), in which a large (18 m long) dragon is paraded through the streets by a host of costumed actors. Some years ago, I was staying in Kyoto for a while. I was lucky enough to just happen to pass by when the procession was being held. I made a drawing based on a picture I took. The drawing is mostly a faithful rendition of the photograph, except for the sky and some of the colours (there is more blue in my drawing). Also, if you look closely, you see that the papier-maché head of the dragon is covered in Japanese characters. Because of the shape of the head and also the resolution of the picture, these were quite hard to read, but I could work out that they were taken from Buddhist sutras. So I searched for the text of a sutra and used that for the parts where I could not read the actual characters. Although the dragon is called “blue”, and sometimes “azure” or “cerulean”, the scales of the dragon in the procession are a dark blue-green tint. In Japanese, the word aoi (青い) means both blue and green, for example a traffic light is aoshingō (青信号). In my drawing I tried to match the original colour of the scales. I have explained my drawing process and the materials I use in a previous post, “Summer night in Shinbashi dōri”. This drawing is on a sheet of 56 cm × 38 cm, also known as “half imperial”, of Arches 300 g/m² “not”, i.e. cold pressed with a rough finish. Here are a few intermediate stages: The line drawing: Some colour applied: Some washing done: And this is the final result: The banner picture shows part of the picture of the dragon on which drawing is based.

The paper is Fabriano Artistico 300 g/m² “not”, cold pressed with a rough finish. The materials I used are my usual combination of plain pencil and Derwent Inktense and Conté Aquarelle watercolour pencils. I started it at the end of March so it took about three months. Topic The topic is a night view of an alley in Kyōto, based on picture I took during my stay in 2018. I picked it because I wanted something with a lot of colour and detail, in portrait format. And because I love Kyōto. Working on that drawing takes me straight back there, to the warmth of the summer night, the typical smells, sounds and visual impressions. And just the feeling of being there. In Japanese there is a word for this feeling of happy memories, natsukashii (懐かしい). It’s close to “nostalgic”, but without negative connotations. The dictionary says “fondly-remembered”. Making a detailed drawing of a night scene is fun and challenging: because of the limitations of taking night shots with my compact camera without tripod, the original image is not entirely sharp; also, some of the brighter signs are washed out. And of course the details in the darker parts are quite lost. So I try to work out the signs and other missing parts by comparing various pictures and searching on the internet for additional, daytime pictures of that alley. Especially the kanji (Chinese characters) on the signs are hard. If I would copy them without really understanding the characters, then the strokes would be wrong and that would be obvious to anyone who can read them. So I need to work out which kanji the often very stylised calligraphy represent. Then I can attempt to write them in the same way. One of the things I like about drawing is that I can change whatever I like. A picture is already a lie, but in a drawing there are so many more ways in which you can alter the reality. Most of what is shown in the drawing was there on the picture. I only lied a little bit. Context The alley is called Shinbashi Dōri (真橋通り). It comes out onto a bridge over the Takasegawa (高瀬川), which is a narrow canal bordered with cherry trees. The bridge is called Shinbashi (真橋) and the alley takes it name from the bridge. It’s close to the much more famous Pontochō Alley (先斗町通り) and not far from the Gion Bridge over the Kamo river. The scene in the drawing is observed from the entrance of the alley from Kawaramachi Dōri (河原町通り), one of the main north-south thoroughfares. Shinbashi Dōri runs parallel with Shijō Dōri (四条通り), one of the main roads running east-west. Already in the Heian era (around 800 CE), Kyōto (then called Heian-Kyō) was laid out on a grid pattern with the imperial palace facing south after the Chinese fashion and the main east-west roads counting up from the palace towards the south. The roads were simply numbered from 1 to 9 starting with Ichijō (#1) just to the north of the palace grounds, Nijō (#2) just to the south, then Sanjō (#3), Shijō (#4) and so on and ending at Kujō (#9). If you’ve read the Tale of Genji, you will recall that Genji had a Nijō residence and one of the important women in his life live was called the Rokujō have because her residence was on Rokujō. Today, Shijō Dōri is the most well-known as it is a major shopping street and it runs to Gion bridge and the Gion quarter. Amazingly, all of these roads still exist, or at least there are still roads and alleys in Kyōto with those names in roughly the same place as the original ones. Drawing process The way I make a drawing like this is quite straightforward: I crop the image to the scene I want, then divide it into squares using guides. I divide the paper in the same number of squares, with pencil and ruler. For detailed parts, I divide the squares into smaller squares. Then I set the drawing up in pencil with the picture on my screen as reference. For this particular drawing, I also looked at the position of the vanishing point and put in perspective guide lines. When I’m happy with that I will usually do some very rough shading and work out some of the details. I like using watercolour pencils. You can apply the colour first like ordinary coloured pencils and then wash them. I usually don’t put on all colour before starting to wash. Maybe that would be more systematic but I tend to postpone the parts that I am unsure about. Colouring in a large drawing like this is much like completing a jigsaw puzzle. Until a certain amount is done it is really hard to say what it will look like, and finding the best way to colour in some small part is also a bit like hunting for the missing pieces. Rules I have a few “rules” for myself when it comes to drawing and watercolours: use rough, heavy paper don’t sharpen the pencils too often don’t use too fine a brush don’t correct mistakes use rough, heavy paper don’t sharpen the pencils too often don’t use too fine a brush don’t correct mistakes Look, that’s why there’s rules, understand?So that you think before you break ‘em.– Terry Pratchett, “Thief of time” The banner picture shows part of the original picture I used for the drawing.

It’s a very nice but difficult novel, I may write more about it later. After I wrote the article on the Buddhist prayer “The Four Wisdoms”, I came across a passage in the novel that describes a Buddhist funeral and it contains a prayer used by the Jōdo Shinshū (浄土真宗, “The True Essence of the Pure Land Teaching”), known as Shinshū in Japan. The prayer The prayer in the book is written in archaic Japanese with old forms of kanji and grammar and uncommon words: The puzzle I could not understand the poem, but I was curious about its meaning so I tried to find out. First of all, here is a list of the special kanji, words and constructions that I did not understand: 弘誓 (ぐぜい, guzei): Buddha’s universal vow 娑婆 (しゃば, shaba): The Sahā world, the mundane world. 佛: an older form of 仏 (butsu), Buddha 仏恩 (ブツオン、ぶっとん, button): Buddha’s blessings, the grace of Buddha’s compassion 弥陀 (みだ,mida): Amitabha (a celestial Buddha, the principal buddha in Pure Land Buddhism) 永劫 (えいごう, here pronounced yōgō): Eternity, perpetuity. 劫 (kō or gō) means kalpa. 浄土 (じょうど, jōdo): Lit. “pure land”, esp. the Western Pure Land paradise of Amitabha. 无爲: old kanji for 無為 mui: asaṃskṛta, the ‘unconditioned’, a term referring to anything that transcends conditioned (saṃskṛta) existence in the state of saṃsāra. 期スル (ごする,go suru): to live 本師 (ホンシ,honshin): Lit. “fundamental guru”, i.e. Buddha 釋: an older form of 釈, lit. shaka, short for Shakamuni (釈迦牟尼), the historical Buddha. 慈恩 (じおん_jion_): deep compassion, benevolence ナリ: なり (nari) is the classical version of である, “to be”. ベシ: べし (beshi) is the classical version of べき, “something one ought to do”. In the prayer, 念 ずべし means 念 ずるべき,”should pray”, and 報 ずべし means 報 ずるべき, “should inform”. 弘誓 (ぐぜい, guzei): Buddha’s universal vow 娑婆 (しゃば, shaba): The Sahā world, the mundane world. 佛: an older form of 仏 (butsu), Buddha 仏恩 (ブツオン、ぶっとん, button): Buddha’s blessings, the grace of Buddha’s compassion 弥陀 (みだ,mida): Amitabha (a celestial Buddha, the principal buddha in Pure Land Buddhism) 永劫 (えいごう, here pronounced yōgō): Eternity, perpetuity. 劫 (kō or gō) means kalpa. 浄土 (じょうど, jōdo): Lit. “pure land”, esp. the Western Pure Land paradise of Amitabha. 无爲: old kanji for 無為 mui: asaṃskṛta, the ‘unconditioned’, a term referring to anything that transcends conditioned (saṃskṛta) existence in the state of saṃsāra. 期スル (ごする,go suru): to live 本師 (ホンシ,honshin): Lit. “fundamental guru”, i.e. Buddha 釋: an older form of 釈, lit. shaka, short for Shakamuni (釈迦牟尼), the historical Buddha. 慈恩 (じおん_jion_): deep compassion, benevolence ナリ: なり (nari) is the classical version of である, “to be”. ベシ: べし (beshi) is the classical version of べき, “something one ought to do”. In the prayer, 念 ずべし means 念 ずるべき,”should pray”, and 報 ずべし means 報 ずるべき, “should inform”. With these terms and the furigana in the novel, I could do a transcription in romaji: guzei no chikara wo kafurazuba idzure no toki ni ka shaba wo iden button fukaku omohitsu, tsune ni mida wo nen zubeshi shaba yōgo no ku wo sute, jōdo mui wo go suru koto honshi shaka no chikara nari jōji ni jion wo hō zubeshi So at least I can now pronounce the prayer, and I get a rough idea of the meaning. But of course I wanted to know the details. The origin By searching for snippets rewritten with modern kanji and hiragana, I found that the prayer is taken from a book of hymns called Kōsō Wasan (『高僧和讃』, the “Japanese Hymns of Praise of the Virtuous Priest”), a collection of hymns written by the founder of the sect, Shinran (親鸞), who lived between 1173 and 1263 and was a remarkable person. In particular, these are the two final hymns from “Twenty-six Hymns based on the Writings of Master Shan-tao”. Shan-tao is one of the seven masters (patriarchs) of Shinshū. He lived from 613 to 681 and is generally credited for popularizing the nembutsu as the reciting of Amida’s name (see below). The meaning The complete works of Shinran in English translation are available on line. The translation of the two hymns taken from there is: Had we not received the power of the universal Vow, When can we part from this Saha world? Reflecting deeply on the Buddha’s benevolence, Let us think on Amida always. Casting off long kalpas of painful existence in this world of Saha, We live in expectation of the Pure Land, the uncreated; That is the power of our teacher, Shakyamuni; Let us respond always in gratitude for his compassion and benevolence. Pure Land Buddhism holds that there is a kind of Paradise called the Pure Land, and once one is there it is easier to reach Nirvana. Shinran advocated to trust to the power of Amitābha (Amida), as made manifest in his Universal Vow, to attain enlightenment. The main Jōdo Shinshū practice is called nembutsu, “Mindfulness of the Buddha”. The nembutsu is simply reciting the phrase Namu Amida Butsu (“I take refuge in Amitābha Buddha”, written 南無阿弥陀佛). For more information see the detailed discussion of the meaning of the hymns. The conclusion This is yet another example of how reading Japanese remains a difficult but very stimulating activity for me: there are lots of riddles to be solved. In translation, most of the mystery disappears. And every time I look into such a little mystery, I learn lots of new things. The banner picture is of the Nishi Hongan-ji (本願寺, Temple of the Primal Vow)) in Kyōto, the largest of all the Jōdo Shinshū branches.

At first glance this seems a very long, hard to pronounce and difficult to remember name, so why name a shop like that? The names of the planets in the solar system The explanation is that the name refers to a mnemonic for the planets in the solar system: each kanji in the name of the shop is the first kanji of the name of a planet, starting from the one closest to the sun. So most Japanese people will recognise and remember the name. And because in Japanese everything gets abbreviated if at all possible, in practice everyone calls the shop “Suikin”. One oddity about the name is that most people will in school have learned the sequence Sui Kin Chi Ka Moku Do Ten Kai Mei ( 水金地火木土天海冥), so the last two names are swapped. This is because when the shop was founded (in 1984), Pluto (冥王星, meiōsei) was closer to the earth than Neptune (海王星, kaiōsei), but because of Pluto’s strongly elliptical orbit, this is only the case for two periods of about 20 years in the total of 248 year it takes to complete one orbit around the Sun. The last time this happened was between 1979 and 1999, and it won’t happen again until 2227. What puzzled me is the connection between the order of the planets and the order of the days of the week in Japanese. The names of the planets are: Table 1. Names of the planets in English and Japanese The suffix -sei (星) actually means “star”. The names of the last three planets are Japanese descriptions of the roles of the gods Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The other five planets are named after the Five Elements (五大, godai) used in Chinese philosophy: water (水), metal (金), fire (火), wood (木), and earth in the sense of soil (土). The days of the week are listed in Table 2. The suffix -yōbi (曜日) means “weekday”. I’ve added the names used in the Roman calendar for comparison. Table 2. Names of the days of the week in English and Japanese and their Roman name The order of the days of the week What I found intriguing is that the days of the week occur in the same order in our calendar and in the Japanese calendar. My first assumption was that the Japanese simply borrowed the Western convention after contact with the West, which would have been in the 16th century at the earliest, but it turns out that this is not the case: the adoption of a 7-day week and the naming of the weekdays was introduced in China in the 4th century (from either ancient Mesopotamia or Egypt, and likely via Greece) and from there in Japan in the 9th century. I found the answer on the website of the Sendai Astronomical Observatory (Sendaishi Tenmondai, 仙台市天文台). What follows is a rewording of that explanation. In ancient times, people read the time and season from the stars in the night sky. They discovered that five of these “stars” were moving in a strange way, overtaking each other and sometimes appearing to move backwards. They called these wakusei (惑星), literally “perplexing stars”. These are the five planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn that can be seen with the naked eye. The ancients thought that planets, the sun and the moon were turning around the earth. As a result of their observations they thought the moon was closest to the earth followed by Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn: Furthermore, the belief was that the sun, the moon, and the five planets were “star gods” (星の神, hoshi no kami) who dominated time and space. And the astronomers observed the moon cycle of 28 days, which was split into four 7-day units, with one day dedicated to each star god. This was the basis for the notion of the ​”week”. The division of the day into 24 hours had already evolved based on the concept of the twelve constellations of the zodiac. Each hour was believed to be controlled by a specific star god, and each day was believed to be dominated by the specific star god controlling the first hour of that day. And the order in which the star gods were assigned to the hours and days was based on the order in which the “stars” were observed. If we start on the first hour of the first day with Saturn, the planet furthest away from the earth, this is Saturn’s day (土曜日). Each hour we move to the next closer planet in the geocentric model: Jupiter, Mars, the Sun,Venus, Mercury and the Moon, and we repeat this process, so after the Moon we start again with Saturn. Doing so, after 24 hours, we arrive at the Sun (日曜日), and 24 hours after that, the Moon (月曜日), then Mars (火曜日), Mercury (水曜日), Jupiter (木曜日), Venus (金曜日), and after one week, this pattern repeats itself and we’re back at Saturn: This is how the ancient astronomers in Mesopotamia or Egypt related the days of the week to the planets, and from there it was adopted in ancient Greece and Rome but also in ancient China and Japan. To my mind it’s really quite amazing to learn that the order of the days of the week relates in this way to the ordering of the “stars” in the geocentric model. Bonus track Here is a small Haskell program that creates the week day sequences from the sequence of the “star gods”: The program performs the operations explained above: it takes the list of “star gods” in geocentric order and reverses them so that “土” (Saturn) is first, this is starGodSequence. It then repeats this list forever (in Haskell you can do this). The concat flattens this list of lists into a single list, starGodsAllHours. The function starGodsDaysFrom is recursive, what it does is take the first element in a list, then drops 24 elements (including this first one), and repeats the process, again potentially forever. We apply this function to starGodsAllHours. This produces a new list which repeats the days of the week forever. Finally, to get the seven days of the week, we take the first seven elements of that new list. The banner photo shows the moon-viewing room (shōgetsurō, 嘯月楼) of the Shisen-dō (詩仙堂) temple in Kyoto.

It is a black-and-white movie from 1953 directed by Yasujirō Ozu about an elderly couple who travel to Tokyo to visit their grown-up children. It’s moving and poetic family story, slow-paced and without much overt drama. I very much like the cinematography, with long static shots of very carefully composed frames. One of my favourite scenes in the movie is a scene in the apartment of the widowed daughter-in-law, Noriko, where the mother, Tomi, bonds with Noriko. The scene is when they’re about to go to sleep. Besides the articles linked in my earlier post, the 1982 article by Keiko McDonald “Ozu’s Tokyo Story: Simple Means for Complex Ends” is one of the best analyses of the movie I’ve read. From that article, here is the description of the preamble to the scene: The scene opens in a typical Ozu manner with a cut from the empty corridor to the inside of the apartment. The shot of the corridor is accompanied by the bong of a clock somewhere, Ozu’s favorite metaphor, which establishes the temporal setting for the dramatic action to follow. It is midnight. Because there are very few indications of clock time in Tokyo Story, the clock chiming midnight is significant, even though the sound in the movie is really faint. In his article on the importance of time in Tokyo Story, Tetsuya Kumamoto explains that the length of the shot in the empty corridor is significantly longer than similar shots in the movie (more than 10 seconds, whereas usually it is about 7-8 seconds), and the only reason for this is precisely to provide enough time for the 12 bongs of the clock. At the same time that Tomi is quietly talking with Noriko, as shown in the preceding scene, Shūkichi is getting drunk with his old acquaintances. We get an indication of the time there as well, as he barmaid urges them to go home “because it’s already midnight”. Keiko McDonalds commentary on the scene following the empty corridor shot: Two quilt beds have already been made, and Noriko is rubbing Tomi’s shoulder. To Japanese audiences this familiar scene is the very index of domestic harmony illuminating the young’s caring for the aged. And on the following scene: After Noriko puts the quilt over her, Tomi hesitantly says that, as her mother-in-law, she feels badly that Noriko remains unmarried now that eight years have passed since her husband’s death. Noriko smilingly responds that she does not want to remarry, not because she is loyal to her late husband, but because she is more comfortable living alone. We must read between the lines of this conversation: there, we find a genuine mutual compassion as these two women articulate a kind of resignation in face of the merciless progression of time. The movie then cuts back to now closed bar, to complete the symmetry. I think the scene is pivotal in the movie, because it leads to Noriko re-evaluating her life. The drawing In the movie, Tomi is played by Chieko Higashiyama and Noriko by Setsuko Hara. I wanted to create a double portrait of Tomi and Noriko, and I stayed very close to the original shot, apart from cropping it to get both faces in an optimal position. I used my preferred rough watercolour paper (Fabriano Artistico, 300 gsm, NOT), about 50 cm x 70 cm. I set up the drawing in ordinary pencil and worked it in Conté pencil (from HB to 3B). I don’t sharpen the Conté pencils to a point. I also used kneaded putty and a piece of soft rag for blending. The banner is a crop of the still on which the drawing is based.

All that remains is the ever-lingering smell of your cigarettes.” 君を待つ日々は足りない　切ない　鳴り止まない 不協和音が響き合って kimi wo matsu hibi wa tarinai setsunai nariyamanai fukyouwaon ga hibikiatte “Waiting for you day after day — it’s futile — heartrending — incessantly ringing — a crashing dissonance.” それがあたしの枯れない　溶けない　鳴り止まない 孤独の唄　来来来… sore ga atashi no karenai tokenai nariyamanai kodoku no uta rai rai rai “That is my unwithering, unthawing, incessantly ringing song of solitude. Come, come, come!” かすかな別れを漂わすこともなく 足音は突然　絶切れた あぁ悲しくも美しき白い冬 kasuka no wakare wo tadayowasu koto mo naku ashioto wa totsuzen tachikireta aa kanashiku utsukushiki shiroi fuyu “Without even a faint hint of parting — The sound of footsteps suddenly cut off. Ah, the sad and beautiful white winter.” 会えるものならば他に何も望まない 降り積もるは　あの日も雪 aeru mono naraba hoka ni nanimo nozomanai furitsumoru wa ano hi mo yuki “If I could only meet you I would not wish for anything else. The snow was falling thickly that day.” 君を待つ日々は足りない　切ない　鳴り止まない 不協和音が響き合って それがあたしの枯れない　溶けない　鳴り止まない 孤独の唄　来来来… kimi wo matsu hibi wa tarinai setsunai nariyamanai fukyouwaon ga hibikiatte sore ga atashi no karenai tokenai nariyamanai kodoku no uta rai rai rai “Waiting for you day after day — it’s futile — heartrending — incessantly ringing — a crashing dissonance. That is my unwithering, unthawing, incessantly ringing song of solitude. Come, come, come!” The title of the song, “Ukifune”, is the name of a character in the “Tale of Genji” (Genji monogatari,源氏物語), a masterpiece of Japanese literature from the early 11th century (Heian period), written by the noblewoman and lady-in-waiting Murasaki Shikibu. The word articles/ukifune (浮舟) is the title of the chapter where the story starts. It can be translated as “A Drifting Boat”. As is common in the Tale of Genji, the name of the chapter is used as a nickname for the character. In this case, the title and the character’s name were based on a poem she wrote in which she calls herself “a drifting boat” to express her uncertainty and inner turmoil: 橘の小島の色は変はらじをこの浮舟ぞ行方知られぬ tachibana no kojima no iro ha kawaraji wo kono ukifune zo yukue chirarenu “The enduring hue of the Isle of Orange Trees may well never change, yet there is no knowing now where this drifting boat is bound” The poem is written in winter, with all the land around Uji deeply covered in snow. With her suitor, they have gone out on the Uji river in small boat and moored at the Isle of Orange Trees. Later in the story, when she finds herself caught between two powerful suitors, and it seems that whichever one she choses it will end badly, Ukifune tries to drown herself in the Uji river. She fails and becomes a nun. In the Heian period, when noble women became nuns, they would cut off their very long hair. And in the tale, it is indeed autumn by the time Ukifune becomes a nun. The song has many other classical references, such as the use of 〜き adjectives (美しき) and the on reading (i.e. the reading derived from the original Chinese proncunciation of the character) rai of 来 (“come”) used as refrain: rai rai rai. The word for “song”, uta, is usually written as 歌 but here as 唄, this more specifically refers to songs accompanied my shamisen, the traditional three-stringed lute. The song’s mode and melody reflects those traditional songs. It is often said that GO!GO!7188’s music is influenced by the enka musical genre, but for this song it is probably more correct to say that it is influenced by the traditional music that gave rise to enka. And although lost love and loneliness are typical enka themes, they are universal themes that are also very common themes in the Tale of Genji. The song starts with a huge reverberating chord, reminiscent of the sound of a biwa (琵琶), a traditional type of lute that in the Heian period was played at the Imperial court. Then follow three verses that repeat the same melody (A) in crescendo. The first word of each verse is a season: spring 春, summer 夏 and autumn 秋. Then a two new melodies (B/C) are introduced, and a new lyrical theme: the verses address the departed lover. This is followed by the refrain, the single character 来 rai (“come”) repeated over and over again. Then follows and instrumental version of A, followed by a dissonant part reflecting the dissonance in the lyrics. After this interlude comes a verse in melody B that is the heart of the song, the moment when the lover left. Its final word is “winter” 冬. The following verse in melody C ends in “snow” 雪 and blends into a repetition of the first verse in melody C and the refrain D: the single syllable ki is both use as the last syllable of the verse, the ki of yuki (“snow”) and the first syllable of the next verse, kimi (“you”). The references to the seasons in the song reflect the important role the seasons play in traditional Japanese culture. The Tale of Genji is full of allusions to the seasons, season-specific rituals and poetry. Traditional Japanese poetry (waka) is also often inspired by the seasons, I discussed some of them in my article “The Beautiful Japan of the Mind”. The banner picture of this article is the statue of Ukifune in Uji, near Kyoto, where the story is set. It is a picture I took during a visit in the summer of 2017. Here is a live version of the song, recorded at Nihon Budokan in 2005. Your browser does not support the audio element.

The movie is based on a manga from 2007 of the same name by Akimi Yoshida (吉田秋生) [1]. The title means “diary of a seaside town”. The seaside town in the story is Kamakura (鎌倉市), an ancient capital of Japan on the Pacific coast. The banner picture shows a view over the town which I took in 2018. The manga and film tell the story of four sisters: after the funeral of their estranged father, the three Koda sisters Sachi, Yoshino and Chika invite their younger half-sister Suzu to come and live with them at the old family home they share in Kamakura. The film covers a year in Suzu’s life and the portraits are from a scene in summer at the end of that year. The film is not so much about the sisters as about how things change with the passage of time, and that passage of time is beautifully suggested in the manga as well as in the movie through subtle references to the seasons. The story starts out in late summer (late August or early September) with the sound of the cicadas: the manga’s first chapter is called semijigure no yamu koro (蝉時雨のやむ頃) which means “the time when the chorus of the cicadas stops” (semi means cicada and jigure is literally “rain shower”). Suzu moves in with the sisters after the traditional Buddhist 49-day period of mourning (chuin, 中陰) for her father’s death, so by then it is early autumn. A bit later, when she joins the local soccer team, the colourful maple leaves (kouyou, 紅葉) show us it’s late autumn, and later yet the sisters are huddled around the kotatsu (a low table with an electric heater attached underneath) in the deep of winter. Then the cherry blossoms (sakurabana, 桜花) herald spring, and the hydrangeas mark the rainy season (tsuyu, 梅雨). At the end of this, the sisters pick the green plums from the plum tree in the garden to make plum wine, and then summer comes, with the fireworks (hanabi, 花火). The scene I have chosen for the portraits is when the sisters are having their own fireworks in their garden. I like it because they are all absorbed in the sparklers; because of the yukatas (summer kimonos) they are wearing for the occasion, which give the scene a timeless quality and provide interesting graphical patterns; and because of the reflection of the light from the sparklers on their faces. The sparklers are called senkō hanabi (線香花火, literally “incense-stick fireworks”). They date back to the Edo period (17th century) and are quite sophisticated: “Well manufactured senkō hanabi are renowned for having 5 phases in the course of its life: birth, infancy, youth, middle age, and old age. In the birth phase, the firework composition burns to leave a wire-like cinder. In the infancy phase, the cinder gradually shrinks and produces a fireball that increases in brilliancy. The youth phase then displays large pine needle shaped sparks that project from the surface of the fireball. Next, in the middle age phase, many small sparks are emitted from the fireball. Then finally, energy fades in the old age phase as the sparks die down and become willow-like.” [2]. That same paper [2] makes the following observation on watching senkō hanabi: “Watching senkō hanabi is like a meditation, mesmerising and calming, allowing thoughts and earthly worries to be temporarily cast aside. Although senkō hanabi only lasts approximately 20 seconds, its brief existence manages to express the sentiment and emotion of an entire life. As the senkō hanabi briefly transitions through each phase, comparisons can accordingly be drawn to the various transitions of one’s own life. The observer is reminded of the rapid change and development in birth and infancy; the vivacious energy of youth; refinement in middle age; and finally, withering in old age. Moreover, the irregular nature of the sparks stresses the randomness and uncertainty of life.” In my portraits the senkō hanabi is not visible but I wanted to capture the meditative atmosphere of the scene. When I make a portrait I want it to be as close to the photograph I start from but at the same time to reflect the subject’s character. I used the senkō hanabi scene to make four individual portraits. The reference picture is quite small, however: if it was printed each part corresponding to a portrait would measure about 5 cm x 7 cm. The drawings are on paper of 38 cm x 56 cm. Scaling up from such a small photograph is one of the challenges. Furthermore, I like to use cold pressed watercolour paper, in this case Arches 300 g/m². This kind of paper has a very coarse grain. It contributes a lot to the texture of the final work, but on the other hand, the coarse grain imposes a limit on the precision with which details can be drawn. Finally, I prefer to use Conté pencils, because they have a much richer, blacker tint than ordinary pencils. But they have a thick, brittle lead that can’t be sharpened to a fine point. Also, Conté pencil strokes can’t be erased. So once they have been drawn they are part of the drawing, right or not. Because of all this, the final outcome of the drawing is not entirely under my control, and I like it that way. For the first portrait, that of Yoshino, I used only Conté pencil and Faber-Castell Graphite Aquarelle pencils, and I washed the drawing to get a deeper black. I was not entirely happy with it, mostly because of the texture of the hair and the background, although the highlights on the face had turned out the way I wanted them and I was pleased with the ginkho pattern on the yukata as well. For the portrait of Sachi, I used essentially the same approach but I decided to add a touch of blue colour to the yukata and use it for highlights as well. I used a Derwent Inktense watercolour pencil for this. Compared to other watercolour pencils, these give a much more intense colour. I rendered the background differently, more abstracted. For the portrait of Suzu, I used pale pink and blue for the pattern of the yukata, and a slightly more magenta-like colour for the obi (sash), for highlights on the face and for the hairband. The final portrait was that of Chika, and it was a bit more challenging because it is very dark and also more cropped than I wanted it for my composition, so I had to extend the right part of it. I again used the same blue with just a few accents of the pink. It is the most abstracted of the four portraits. When these three portraits were done, I was no longer satisfied with the first one of Yoshino so I redid it. The composition is different, with the figure much larger, and I changed the position of the torso so that more of the yukata is visible. I used the same Derwent Inktense blue as for the other portraits on the yukata, and the same style of background treatment.

Fuss-free food Updated March 19, 2017 About Blog Terms About Blog Terms © 2024   Jekyll theme Skinny Bones","tags":"","url":"recipes/yubamaki-hijiki-nasu/index.html"}, {"title":"The age of blooms","text":" The age of blooms One of my favourite movies is Wong Kar-Wai’s movie “In the mood for love”, from 2000. It’s set in Hong Kong in the early 1960s, almost all scenes are at night and it rains a lot. It’s a tale of love and unfaithfulness. Wong Kar-Wai says Is it basically a love story about these two characters? Finally I think it’s more than that. It’s about the end of a period. 1966 marks a turning point in Hong Kong’s history. The Cultural Revolution in the mainland had lots of knock-on effects, and forced Hong Kong people to think hard about their future. Many of them had come from China in the late 40s, they’d had nearly 20 years of relative tranquillity, they’d built themselves new lives – and suddenly they began to feel they’d have to move on again. So 1966 is the end of something and the beginning of something else. A lot has been written about this movie, reviews, essays, in -depth analysis of what makes it so special. I want to talk about a novel a and a song that are closely tied to the movie. And about the drawings of course. A novel The movie has intertitles at the start and the end: It is a restless moment. She has kept her head lowered, to give him a chance to come closer. But he could not, for lack of courage. She turns and walks away. That era has passed. He remembers those vanished years. Nothing that belonged to it exists any more. As though looking through a dusty window pane, The past is something he could see, but not touch. And everything he sees is blurred and indistinct. This is adapted from novella “Duidao” (“Intersection”) by Liu Yichang. Wong Kar-Wai says: The first work by Liu Yichang I read was Duidao. The title is a Chinese translation of tête-bêche, which describes stamps that are printed top to bottom facing each other. Duidao centres round the intersection of two parallel stories – of an old man and a young girl. One is about memories, the other anticipation. To me, tête-bêche is more than a term for stamps or intersection of stories. It can be the intersection of light and colour, silence and tears. Tête-bêche can also be the intersection of time: for instance, youthful eyes on an aging face, borrowed words on revisited dreams. Or a novel published in 1972, a movie released in 2000, both intersecting to become a story of the ’60s. In her essay “In The Mood for love: intersections of Hong Kong modernity”, Audrey Yue summarises the novel as follows: Set in 1970s Hong Kong, Duidao tells the parallel stories of Chunyu Bai, an old reporter from Shanghai who fled to Hong Kong in the 1940s to escape the Japanese Occupation, and Ah Xing, a young single woman who lives with her parents. Bai is nostalgic, fuelled by his memories of Shanghai, his youthful liaisons with dancehall girls and his failed marriage. Ah Xing is forward-looking. Always day-dreaming about herself as a famous singer or a movie star, she longs to find love and marry a handsome husband, someone ‘a bit like Ke Junxiong, a bit like Deng Guangrong, a bit like Bruce Lee, and a bit like Alain Delon’. Triggered by songs, old photographs, and magazine covers and posters of movie stars, the two characters’ temporalities are retrospective and projective. In the story, they only meet once sitting next to each other in a crowded cinema. Everyday practices like walking, commuting, listening to music, watching television and going to the movies highlight their close encounters. These practices construct Hong Kong, already a Chinese migrant enclave and a metropolis dizzy with escalating property prices and swirling in the popular media mix of Taiwanese Mandarin pop songs, Filipino renditions of American Top Ten hits, Hollywood cinema and French film icons. A song The title of the movie, 花樣年華, Fa Yeung Nin Wa in Cantonese transliteration, is taken form a 1940s song Hua Yang De Nian Hua (花样的年华) “Age of Bloom” by famous 1940s singer Zhou Xuan. It is this song that Mr. Chan, on business Japan, requests to be played for his wife’s birthday. It’s a melancholy song talking about a happy past that is no longer, and it can also easily be interpreted as a reference to the Japanese occupation. The song was released after the war, in 1947, as part of the movie “Sauvignon Blanc”. But there is a reference to a solitary island, and a period of gloom and yearning for the homeland. The period between the start of the Battle of Shanghai in August of 1937 and the outbreak of the Pacific War in late 1941 is known as the Solitary Island Period. During this time, the International Settlement and French Concession in Shanghai were not occupied by the Japanese but the rest of the city was occupied. The filmmakers who remained worked in these foreign concessions. There is an interesting article about Zhou Xuan that provides more context about the Shanghai movie scene in the 1930s and 1940s. The writer of the song, Fan Yanqiao, worked for one of those film companies. Likely he used his recollection of that time as inspiration. (He also wrote the original script for “Sauvignon Blanc”, called “Flowers Bloom In Streets”.) The composer of the song is Chen Gexin, under the pseudonym Lin Mei. He wrote this song in Hong-Kong during a brief happy period in his life. Wong Kar-Wai also made a short film, named Hua Yang De Nian Hua, after the track, consisting of short scenes of movies of that era, with the song as soundtrack. Clearly he considered the song and its background important. I found this translation of the song’s lyrics: Age of bloom, spirits like the Moon A crystal mind like ice and snow Such a beautiful life, such an adoring couple A family so whole and complete Suddenly this lone-standing island, Is covered by shattered mist and sorrowful rain Shattered mist and sorrowful rain Ah, my beloved homeland When can I return to your warm embrace? When will the mist and cloud be dispelled And release your fogged light? Age of bloom, spirits like the Moon And another one, with a contemporary rendition. We are young, like blooming flowers We are fresh, like the shining moon We are sharp, like ice and snow. We have a beautiful life, tender lovers and happy families. But suddenly this lonely island is shrouded in a miserable foggy gloom. A miserable foggy gloom. Ah! My dear motherland, when can we return to your arms? When will the dark clouds and fog disperse? When will we see the light again? We are young, like blooming flowers We are fresh, like the shining moon.

I made a drawing of what is probably my favourite scene in Wong Kar-Wai’s movie “In the mood for love”. The protagonists, Su Li-zhen (“Mrs. Chan”) played by Maggie Cheung Man-yuk and Chow Mo-wan played (“Mr. Chow”) by Tony Leung Chiu-wai, pass each other by on a dark, narrow staircase. They steal a glance at each other and the scene is very evocative. All the time I was working on it, Shigeru Umebayashi’s beautiful music “Yumeji’s Theme” was playing in my head. It’s done on Schoellershammer watercolour paper, 30x40 cm, 250g/m², with the Chinese ink I wrote about a while ago, and two Chinese brushes. The ink is excellent but the paper and the brushes are not great. As a result, there is a lack of control that I find interesting. In another, the couple is together in a taxi, after Mr. Chow has told Mrs. Chan of his intention to move to Singapore. I think the expressions on their faces are very evocative of their complex feelings. It’s just before we hear Mrs. Chan’s off-screen voice saying, “I don’t want to go home tonight.” That’s the scene I wanted to draw. I wanted to create a double portrait of this couple who are, as a BFI critic put it “ordinary mortals made movie-star beautiful by love”, and I stayed very close to the original shot, apart from cropping it to get both faces in an optimal position. I used my preferred rough watercolour paper (Fabriano Artistico, 300 gsm, NOT), about 50 cm x 70 cm. I set up the drawing in ordinary pencil and then added tone with Conté pencils (from HB to 3B). Because the paper has such a rough grain, the pencils can’t fill the hollows in it, and I took care not to smudge the strokes. The effect is therefore not a deep, intense black but something more pointillist. The banner is a crop of the still on which the drawing is based.

I made another drawing, this time based on a pictures I took of musicians on a festival float. I’d like to share the background to and the making of the drawing. The Gion Matsuri The Gion Matsuri (祇園祭) is Kyoto’s most famous festival, held at the start of summer. The festival itself can be dated back all the way to the Heian era, around 870. It originated as a ritual for purification and pacification of evil spirits causing summer diseases and was at first connected with the Shintō deity of the Gion Shrine (Yasaka Shrine). The festival has been held annually since 970. As early as the late 10th century two types of floats were paraded through the streets accompanied by musicians, dancers, and actors. During the Edo period (1600 to 1868) the matsuri became a way in which merchants could show off their wealth as well as their international outlook. In that period, the decoration of the floats became more detailed and luxurious and many started incorporating foreign artwork. In particular cotton merchants were among the parishioners of the Gion Shrine, so that textiles have always formed an important part of the festival decoration. The floats currently used in the parade mostly date from the end of the Edo era. The Yamaboko float parade On the morning of 17 July there is a parade (junkō, 巡行) of festival floats through the streets of the city. There are two float types, yama (山, meaning “mountain” but also “festival float”) and hoko (鉾, meaning both “festival float” and “halberd”), hence the name yamaboko junkō (山鉾巡行). The Koi Yama The yama is a rectangular box containing an artificial mountain crowned by a tree, usually a pine. Textiles decorate the four sides. This type of float is carried through the streets on the shoulders of young men. I want to mention one of these yama in particular, although it has nothing to do with my drawing. The koi yama (鯉山, “carp float”) features a huge carp swimming upstream towards the sky. This refers to the Chinese legend about a carp who desired to become a dragon and had to go through many trials to reach the Dragon Gate Waterfall. What is particularly interesting about the Koi Yama float are the decorations: they consist of parts of an authentic 16th-century Flemish tapestry depicting scenes of the Trojan War. It was quite a surprise to me to find a Flemish tapestry decorating a festival float in Kyoto. So I wanted to find out more, and this is the story: In the 16th century, Flemish tapestries were luxury items coveted throughout Europe, and common as diplomatic gifts. The Japanese nobles were particularly interested in images of warriors [3]. The Koi Yama tapestry was part of a set of six created by the atelier of the Flemish weaver Nicaise Aerts in Brussels in the 1590s, probably based on cartoons by the famous Michel Coxie. There are different theories of how they came to Japan. The could have been brought to Japan by the Portuguese on request of the Jesuits around 1605 [3] as a gift to the first Tokugawa shōgun Ieyasu, or by the Netherlands East India Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie; VOC) in 1633 [1], as a diplomatic gift to the third Tokugawa shōgun Iemitsu. Or maybe they could have been gifts from Pope Paolo V to daimyō Date Masamune’s diplomatic/trade mission to Europe, and entered Japan as contraband just as the Tokugawa shōgun closed Japan to limit foreign influence (in 1633) [4]. Later, when the power moved from the shōguns to the merchant classes, the tapestries were sold on. One was lost early on and one during a fire in 1909, but the other four, though mostly cut up, still survive. Around 1800, one of them was acquired to serve as decoration for the Koi Yama, and cut into nine pieces using “a carpenter’s chisel” (daiku no nomi, 大工のノミ) [2]. There is some dispute as to the scenes depicted on the Koi Yama tapestries, as indeed on the other tapestries in the set: some scholars say they are from the Illiad, and show King Priam and Queen Hecuba [2]; others say the set is based on the Aeneid and that the Koi Yama tapestry shows the Roman emperor Augustus, the descendant of Aeneas [3].

Pawasarat, 2019 The Naginata Hoko The hoko is a tall, rectangular tower with a steepled roof, placed on huge wooden wheels. Underneath the roof there is room for musicians and actors, or dolls representing heroes and heroines from the legendary or historical past. All four sides of the tower are hung with textiles. This type of float is pulled through the streets by teams of thirty to forty men. There are 32 floats in the Yamaboko Junko, and each year their order is decided by lots drawn officially by the Mayor of Kyoto, except for one: the Naginata Hoko (長刀鉾) always leads the procession. The name comes from the naginata, a long sword or halberd, that decorates its central pole. Legendary Heian swordsmith Sanjō Munechika (Sanjō no Kokaji) crafted the original halberd sword in the 10th century. The halberd is said to have the power to exorcise the evil spirits which cause epidemics. When I was at the yoiyama (宵山, the day before the parade) in 2012 I took a few pictures of musicians in a hoko, and it was only when I decided to make a drawing based on it that I realised this is not just a float, but the famous Naginata Hoko. There is a lot more to be said about this particular float, I have provided some links below. Kitsune masks and yukata I decided to give the characters in the drawing fox masks to make the scene more distinct. Fox masks (kitsune men, 狐面) have a long tradition in Japan. In Shinto, the fox is a messenger of the god (kami, 神) Inari, who is the protector of rice, agriculture, and fertility. The gods themselves can take on fox shapes. The mask are use in Noh, Shinto music and dance (kagura, 神楽) and kabuki performances and worn at many festivals – and of course by Babymetal’s Kami band. I was particularly inspired by the mask worn by the character Gin in the wonderful anime Hotarubi no Mori e (蛍火の杜へ, “To the Forest of the Light of the Fireflies”), but I researched other mask variants as well, in particular because the musicians have to wear half-masks. The musicians in my drawing wear the same summer kimonos (yukata) as in the picture, save a few minor details, but for the other characters I used different patterns based on other pictures I took. The drawing Just like the Ranryōō dancer drawing, I wanted a drawing with bright colours and a lot of detail, and the float has really abundant detail and colour. It is quite amazing how every part of the surface has some detailed decoration. I think I now appreciate the float a lot more because to draw it I had to study every little detail in the picture. I also like to have human figures in my drawings. I think the fox masks make the scene more interesting than the original picture. The paper for this drawing is Fabriano Artistico 56cm x 76cm 300g/m2 “rough” watercolour paper. It’s a really nice paper with a very pronounced grain. As usual I did not tape it on a board but it only buckled a little. I used mainly Derwent Inktense, which do give quite deep colours, but also Conté Aquarelle and Faber-Castell Graphite Aquarelle pencils. As usual I started the drawing with a ghost drawing in pencil. Because of the size of the drawing, I used a grid to make sure the figure was positioned correctly. The focus of detail is on the characters and in particular the masks, the further away from these the more sketchy and impressionistic I treated the drawing. Then I added detail and colour with the watercolour pencils. The float has a lot of gold and silver on the hangings, and these are very difficult to render in colour pencil. The level of details is such that to really reproduce it would require very smooth paper and very fine brushes. I picked the coarse paper on purpose and the pencils are not particularly sharp. This forces me to abstract a lot of the detail. Next I did some separate sketches for the non-musician characters, because they are to my mind very important in this drawing. I left the characters until the end and washed the watercolours starting from the bottom. Finally I did the characters. The eyes on the masks are the only places where I used a very fine brush, because a tiny change in the shape can make a big change in expression. Then I did another pass of the entire drawing. I darkened the background behind the characters and the ceiling to have more contrast. To finish the drawing I added a description in Japanese: 狐 長 祇 の 刀 園 面 鉾 祭 which reads Gion matsuri naginata hoko kitsune no men and means “Gion festival / Halberd float / Fox masks”. The “の” is not really required but I wanted the characters to form a 3x3 grid.

I had read his novel “The Master of Go” (名人) and recently I listened to the BBC dramatised version of “A thousand cranes” (千羽鶴). This led me to look up his Nobel lecture “Japan, the Beautiful and Myself” and it made a great impression on me, in particular his discussion of poems by Zen Buddhist monks. The English translation by the eminent Edward Seidensticker is excellent, but inevitably some features of the original get lost in translation. This is why I prefer to attempt to read the original Japanese text. The Nobel Prize site provides a Japanese version of the lecture but unfortunately it is a series of images of handwritten text. The handwriting is incredibly regular but the images have such a low resolution that the text is very hard to read. Because of the poor quality, to read it I first created a readable version of the Japanese text. There have been two other Japanese Nobel laureates, Kenzaburo Oe and Kazuo Ishiguro (who was born in Japan but moved to the UK at the age of five). Both these authors wrote and delivered their lectures in English, so there is no original Japanese version. Kenzaburo Oe discusses Yasunari Kawabata’s lecture in his own Nobel lecture, titled “Japan, The Ambiguous, and Myself”, a clear reference to the title of Kawabata’s lecture: “Kawabata Yasunari, the first Japanese writer who stood on this platform as a winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, delivered a lecture entitled Japan, the Beautiful, and Myself. It was at once very beautiful and vague. I have used the English word vague as an equivalent of that word in Japanese aimaina. This Japanese adjective could have several alternatives for its English translation. The kind of vagueness that Kawabata adopted deliberately is implied in the title itself of his lecture. It can be transliterated as ‘myself of beautiful Japan’. The vagueness of the whole title derives from the Japanese particle ‘no’ (literally ‘of’) linking ‘Myself’ and ‘Beautiful Japan’.” “The vagueness of the title leaves room for various interpretations of its implications. It can imply ‘myself as a part of beautiful Japan’, the particle ‘no’ indicating the relationship of the noun following it to the noun preceding it as one of possession, belonging or attachment. It can also imply ‘beautiful Japan and myself’, the particle in this case linking the two nouns in apposition, as indeed they are in the English title of Kawabata’s lecture translated by one of the most eminent American specialists of Japanese literature. He translates ‘Japan, the beautiful and myself’. In this expert translation the traduttore (translator) is not in the least a traditore (betrayer).” I will come back to Oe’s views on Kawabata’s lecture later. The Nobel lecture by Kazuo Ishiguro is also very much worth reading. I like in particular his description of his realisation that “his” Japan is a mental construct: “I was starting to accept that ‘my’ Japan perhaps didn’t much correspond to any place I could go to on a plane; that the way of life of which my parents talked, that I remembered from my early childhood, had largely vanished during the 1960s and 1970s; that in any case, the Japan that existed in my head might always have been an emotional construct put together by a child out of memory, imagination and speculation. And perhaps most significantly, I’d come to realise that with each year I grew older, this Japan of mine — this precious place I’d grown up with — was getting fainter and fainter.” I have always been convinced that any place we visit, or a place where we come from but no longer live, is essentially a place “of the mind”, and that is why everyone’s experience of visiting the same place is so different. Our minds best retain the memories that made the strongest impressions on us, and what these are is different for everyone. I have been to Japan several times, twice for visits of several months. During these visits I’ve worked with researchers at the Disaster Prevention Research Institute of Kyoto University, and explored the temples and shrines of Kyoto. Kawabata’s views and ideas resonate with me because they are close to my “Japan of the mind”. Source text and translation Kawabata was born in 1899 and received the Nobel prize in 1968. This means that he learned to write in the period between 1900 and 1946 when the usage of kana was based on historical principles, i.e. they reflected the historical pronunciation rather than the actual one. For example, the verb iru “to be” was written in hiragana as ゐる (wiru) rather than いる (iru). The noun kao “face” was written かほ (kaho) rather than かお (kao). In general, many kana writings used the “h”+vowel (ha, he etc.) and “w”+vowel (wo,wi etc.) were in modern Japanese only the vowel is used; for some words, what is now ka was kwa, written くわ. Other difference were the spelling やう (yau) instead of よう(you), せう(seu) instead of しょう (shou) and similar. In 1946 the kana spelling was reformed into the simpler, pronunciation-orientated spelling that is still the standard in modern Japanese. Many kanji were also simplified. Nevertheless, Kawabata’s Nobel lecture is largely written in the old spelling, and uses some of the old-style kanji (旧漢字, kyuukanji). This gives the text a peculiar old-fashioned character that is not obvious from the translation. Note for example the spelling of 言へる (now 言える) and してゐます (now しています) in one of the first sentences in the essay, a commentary on a poem by the Zen poet Myoe: 明恵のこの歌には、歌物語と言へるぼどの、長く詳しい詞書きがあって、歌のこころを明らかにしてゐます。 Myoe no kono uta ni wa, utamonogatari to iheru hodo no, nagakukuwashii kotobagaki ga atte, uta no kokoro wo akiraka ni shitewimasu. As Kenzaburo Oe pointed out above, exact translation is impossible. For example, Kawabata comments that the explanatory note (kotobagaki, 詞書き ) by Myoe on this own poem is so long and detailed that it could be said to be an utamonogatari(歌物語, meaning a “short Heian period tale in the form of a poem”), a level of detail not present in the translation which simply says: “The second poem bears an unusually detailed account of its origins, such as to be an explanation of the heart of its meaning” In the essay, many poems are quoted, most of them by Buddhist monks. The translator, Edward Seidensticker, received help from a Buddhist scholar (Jikai Fujiyoshi,藤吉慈海) for the quotations and references. They had to translate them in a great rush as Kawabata was still writing his lecture in his hotel on the morning that he had to deliver it. In the original Japanese text, the old poems are written in classical Japanese (kobun, 古文) which is a very different language from modern Japanese, with different grammar and vocabulary. As it is impossible to render this in English, we get a modern translation instead. To a Japanese reader, the poems therefore have an entirely different feeling, probably similar to what an English reader experiences with the original Beowulf, or a Dutch speaker reading Karel ende Elegast. This is of course not essential to the message of the lecture but it illustrates the difficulties facing the translator. Zen Buddhism and poetry Most of the poems quoted are tanka, (短歌 meaning “short poem”), a poem consisting of 31 mora in five units, usually following a 5-7-5-7-7 pattern of mora per unit. For example, the first poem (written here a unit per line to show the structure) is 春は花 夏ほととぎす 秋は月 冬雪ざえて 冷しかりけり “In the spring, cherry blossoms, in the summer the cuckoo. In autumn the moon, and in winter the snow, clear, cold.” and the second one 雲を出でて 我にとちなふ 冬の月 風や身にしむ 雪や冷めたき “The winter moon comes from the clouds to keep me company. The wind is piercing, the snow is cold.” What I find most interesting is Kawabata’s observation on this second poem. Myoe provided the following note about his inspiration for this poem: “When the hour of the midnight vigil came, I ceased meditation and descended from the hall on the peak to the lower quarters, and as I did so the moon came from the clouds and set the snow to glowing. The moon was my companion, and not even the wolf howling in the valley brought fear. “ Kawabata says: “My reason for choosing [this poem] has to do with its remarkable gentleness and compassion. Winter moon, going behind the clouds and coming forth again, making bright my footsteps as I go to the meditation hall and descend again, making me unafraid of the wolf: does not the wind sink into you, does not the snow, are you not cold? I choose the poem as a poem of warm, deep, delicate compassion, a poem that has in it the deep quiet of the Japanese spirit.” Kawabata further discusses a particular poem that is very easy to understand, but nevertheless loses a lot in translation, because the visual effect and structure are untranslatable: あかあかやあかあかあかやあかあかやあかあかあかやあかあかや月 aka aka ya aka aka aka ya aka aka ya aka aka aka ya aka aka ya tsuki Notice that even this poem is a tanka! The translation is “Bright, bright, and bright, bright, bright, and bright, bright. Bright and bright, bright, and bright, bright moon.” Kawabata observes: “Seeing the moon, he becomes the moon, the moon seen by him becomes him. He sinks into nature, becomes one with nature. The light of the “clear heart” of the priest, seated in the meditation hall in the darkness before the dawn, becomes for the dawn moon its own light.” Zen monks like Dogen and Myoe spent a lot of their time in meditation. As a result, they were able to live as much in the present as possible and to have as little sense of self as possible. Dogen and Myoe lived in the 13th century. The final poem I want to highlight is the deathbed poem of the priest Ryokan who lived much later (1758-1831): 形見として何か残さん舂は花山ほととぎす秋はもみぢ葉 “What shall be my legacy? The blossoms of spring, The cuckoo in the hills, the leaves of autumn.” Kawabata says “In this poem, as in Dogen’s, the commonest of figures and the commonest of words are strung together without hesitation — no, to particular effect, rather — and so they transmit the very essence of Japan.” and further “Ryokan pursued literature and belief in the benign spirit summarized in the Buddhist phrase “a smiling face and gentle words”. In his last poem he offered nothing as a legacy. He but hoped that after his death nature would remain beautiful. That could be his bequest.” The phrase “a smiling face and gentle words” is a “four-kanji idiom” (yojijukugo,四字熟語), pronounced as wagan aigo. Its origin is from a Buddhist text called “The Sutra of Immeasurable Life”: “With an expression of tenderness in his face and with kindness in his speech, he spoke to others in consonance with their inner thoughts.” It carries the connotation that the bodhisattva speaks gentle words to guide people. The web site of the Honganji temple in Kyoto has a nice explanation (in Japanese). Why did Kawabata include these poems in his lecture? In his own Nobel lecture, Kenzaburo Oe expresses his views on the use of classical poetry in Kawabata’s lecture: “Even as a twentieth-century writer Kawabata depicts his state of mind in terms of the poems written by medieval Zen monks. Most of these poems are concerned with the linguistic impossibility of telling truth. According to such poems words are confined within their closed shells. The readers can not expect that words will ever come out of these poems and get through to us. One can never understand or feel sympathetic towards these Zen poems except by giving oneself up and willingly penetrating into the closed shells of those words.” “Why did Kawabata boldly decide to read those extremely esoteric poems in Japanese before the audience in Stockholm? I look back almost with nostalgia upon the straightforward bravery which he attained towards the end of his distinguished career and with which he made such a confession of his faith. Kawabata had been an artistic pilgrim for decades during which he produced a host of masterpieces. After those years of his pilgrimage, only by making a confession as to how he was fascinated by such inaccessible Japanese poems that baffle any attempt fully to understand them, was he able to talk about ‘Japan, the Beautiful, and Myself’, that is, about the world in which he lived and the literature which he created.” Fuss-free food Updated January 15, 2021 About Blog Terms About Blog Terms © 2024   Jekyll theme Skinny Bones","tags":"","url":"articles/my-own-private-japan/index.html"}, {"title":"Tokyo Story","text":" Tokyo Story Tokyo Story (tōkyō monogatari, 東京物語) is a probably one of the most famous Japanese films, and definitely one of my favourites. It is a black-and-white movie from 1953 directed by Yasujirō Ozu about an elderly couple who travel to Tokyo to visit their grown-up children. It’s moving and poetic family story, slow-paced and without much overt drama. I very much like the cinematography, with long static shots of very carefully composed frames. There is an article from the British Film Institute that provides a nice analysis of the movie and this article in FilmInquiry discusses the politics. The movie was released in 1953 and is quite critical of the Japanese society at the time. There also is a very interesting article about the notion of time in this movie (in Japanese, abstract in French), “Recurrent time and irreversible time in Yasujirō Ozu’s Tokyo Story”. It explains how the parents, living in a traditional small village, experience time differently from the children living in the modern city, and how this is illustrated through the way time is handled in the movie. Starting material I wanted to make a drawing based on period posters for this movie. So I looked up a number of posters and composed a version with the three key figures of the final part of the movie, the father (Shūkichi), his daughter Kyōko and the widow of his son, Noriko. Here are the two posters I used: Selecting the text For a poster, the text is an essential part of the artwork. I wanted to keep some of the original promotion text but also add some that is taken from the movie itself. Of course I kept the title, I used the lettering as in the first poster. I kept the original line of one of the posters: 香り高き詩情　美と哀愁の藝術作 The first part means literally “fragrant poetic sentiment”, so maybe “a strong sense of poetry”; the second part means “a work of art of beauty and sorrow”. I slightly modified another line from one of the posters: 一年一作小津安二郎作品 became 最高の小津安二郎作品 which means “Yasujirō Ozu’s best work” I also incorporated what I consider the most memorable exchange in the movie: For me this has always been the most memorable exchange in Tokyo Story. Noriko, the widowed daughter-in-law is talking to Kyoko, the younger daughter. 京子：「いやぁねぇ、世の中って……」 紀子：「そう、いやなことばっかり……」 The English subtitles translate this as Kyoko: “Isn’t life disappointing?” Noriko: “Yes, nothing but disappointment.” “disappointment” is probably too strong though. いや (iya) is a term meaning disagreeable, unpleasant etc. 世の中 “yo no naka” means “world, society”, and the って means something like “what you call … “ or “the so-called …” This is the conclusion of a longer exchange in which Noriko explains to Kyoko that it is inevitable that children drift apart once they have their own lives to live. I like this exchange because it summarizes what it means to grow up. I stylised this a bit differently for the drawing: 京子〜嫌なね、世の中って 紀子〜そう、嫌な事許り At the end of the movie, a children’s choir sings the song “The evening bell” (yuube no kane, 夕べの鐘) and I incorporated the lyrics into the poster as well: 昔の人     今や何處 訪れ来て     佇めば 黄昏ゆく     空を辿 通いて来る     鐘の声 家鳩の     羽搏きに 乱れて消ゆ     軒の妻 緑の風     岸を戦ぐ I only incorporated the lyrics that are sung in the movie, there is a little bit more: 川のほとり     さまよえば 黄昏ゆく     路地を越えて おとない来る     鐘の声 牧の童が     笛の音に 消えては行く     村はずれ I have not seen any mention of this song in articles about the movie, and yet it is significant, because it describes an evening scene in a small village by a river, the kind of village where the father and daughter live. I could not find a translation, I did my best to translate it but the song is from 1908 and besides being poetry, it uses some archaic constructions. the people of yore, where are they now maybe they loiter and come to visit the gathering dusk creeps across the sky the sound of the bell coming and going vanishing eaves, disturbed by the flapping of pigeon wings   the green wind stirring the bank wandering around the river dusk creeps across the paths through the fields the sound of the bell comes to visit a shepherd boy with the sound of a flute fading away on the edge of the village The background to the choice of this song in the movie is interesting. This was a song taught to school children before the war, but after the war, by the time the movie was made, it had been replaced by another song, “Spring breeze”, with the same melody but different lyrics. So why did Ozu choose this particular song? This song is much more serious in tone than Spring Breeze, it has something of a requiem or elegy. I read an interesting story about the possible reason for this choice. Yasujiro Ozu’s assistant director, Yoshio Tsukamoto, died from leukaemia at the age of 39 shortly before the filming of the movie had started. They had been very close and had been through the war together, in Singapore. They were interned there after the war and when a ship came to repatriate them, there were not enough places. Ozu ceded his place but Tsukamoto stayed with him. Ozu was deeply affected by Tsukamoto’s death, and this song was his way of expressing his grief in the movie. This may have been the case but even without this personal background, the choice of the song is perfect for the final scene, cutting between Noriko in the train and Kyōko classroom. There is even a nice connection with the two notions of time: Noriko on the train steaming to Tokyo, looking at the watch signifying the irreversible time, and the temple bell in the song, which epitomises the recurrent time. The drawing The drawing process and the materials I used for this drawing are the same as for the drawings discussed in my previous posts, “The Blue Dragon of Kiyomizu-dera” and “Summer night in Shinbashi dōri”. This drawing is on a sheet of watercolour paper of 56 cm × 76 cm (30×22 inches) of Fabriano Artistico 300 g/m² “not”, cold pressed with a rough finish. I only took one intermediate picture, of the the line drawing: And this is the final result: hiragana and romaji of the text For learners of Japanese, here are the hiragana and romaji for the text on the poster. 香り高き詩情　美と哀愁の藝術作 かおりたかきしじょう　びとあいしゅうのげいじゅつか kaoritakaki shijou bi to aishuu no geijutsuka 最高の小津安二郎作品 さいこうのおつやすじろうさくひん saikou no otsu yasujirou sakuhin 京子：「いやぁねぇ、世の中って……」 紀子：「そう、いやなことばっかり……」 きょうこ：「いやぁねぇ、よのなかって……」 のりこ：「そう、いやなことばっかり……」 Kyouko: iyaa nee, yo no nakatte… Noriko: sou, iya na koto bakari… 東京物語 とうきょうものがたり tōkyō monogatari ゆうべのかね むかしのひといまいずこ おとずれきてたたずめば たぞがれゆくそらをたどり かよいてくるかねのおと いえばとのはばたきに みだれてきゆのきのつま   みどりのかぜきしをそよぐ かわのほとりさまよえば たぞがれゆくやろをこえて おとないくるかねのおと まきのわらべふえのおと きえてはゆくむらはずれ yuube no kane mukashi no hito ima izuko? otozure kite tatazumeba tazogare yuku sora wo tadori kayoite kuru kane no oto iebato no habataki ni midarete kiyu noki no tsuma   　 midori no kaze kishi wo soyogu kawa no hotori samayoeba tazore yuku yaro wo koete otonai kuru kane not oto maki no warabe fue no oto ni kiete wa yuku murahazure The banner picture shows a black-and-white picture of the father and his daughter-in-law in the same pose as on the poster.

As a slow learner of Japanese, I often have to look up kanji (Chinese characters) in my dictionary. I was intrigued to notice that for some kanji, one of their meanings is a very large number: Table 1. Kanji for large numbers with readings and number values Kanji and the supercomputer For example, the character 京, which is the “kyō” in Kyoto (京都) means “metropolis”, but also 1016. For that meaning it is pronounced “kei”, and this is the origin of the name of the famous Riken supercomputer in Kobe, the “K computer”: it is a computer capable of 10 petaflops, so 1016 or kei flops. Incidentally, it is probably the only supercomputer that has its own railway station, 京コンピュータ前駅. Counting systems The story of how these kanji came to represent such large numbers is quite interesting. It started with the emergence of a number of different counting systems. Japan has adopted kanji from China – the word kanji (漢字) means Chinese characters, the 漢 character meaning “Han”. The traditional numeral systems of China, Korea, and Japan are all decimal-based but grouped into ten thousands, also known as myriads (man, 万), rather than thousands. Very long ago, the characters beyond man simply indicated degrees of large, so oku (億) was larger than man (万), chō (兆) was larger than oku, kei (京) was larger than chō, etc. Actual counting of numbers beyond one myriad was ten myriads, hundred myriads, thousand myriads. Then over time the characters oku, chō, kei etc. started to be used for this, in a counting system called kasū (下数,かすう, “lower arithmetic”). So in this system, oku was ten times man, chō was ten times oku, etc. This was very long ago, more than two thousand years, and clearly it was not entirely satisfactory because already from the Han dynasty onwards (i.e. 200 BCE), a separate counting system called jōsū（上数,じょうすう,”upper arithmetic”）also became used. In this system, the character after man got the value of man man (万万), so oku = man man = 108. The next value chō became oku oku (億億) = 1016, kei = chō chō (兆兆) =1032 and so on. Later, yet another system, called chūsū (中数,ちゅうすう,”middle arithmetic”) came into use. In this system, the values for consecutive kanji where 104 apart. To be precise, in China there were two variants of chūsū, manshin (万進) and (万万進) manmanshin, the latter had intervals of 108. The table below summarises the various systems: Table 2. Summary of the different counting systems used historically An Edo-era mathematics book In Edo-era Japan, the 1634 edition of an influential mathematics book, jinkōki (塵劫記), standardised on the chūsū/manshin (中数/万進) system as shown in the table above. The work covers a wide variety of mathematical problems but its main purpose was to explain techniques for calculating using the soroban (算盤), the Japanese abacus. The daimyo, the samurai and the soroban The oldest soroban in existence is the Shibei Shigekatsu hairyo soroban, from 1591. It was made from plum tree wood and silver and given to the samurai Shibei Shigekatsu by the famous daimyō Toyotomi Hideyoshi (The word hairyo (拝領) means “receiving from a superior”). It shows that this kind of calculating device was highly valued. This soroban has 20 number rods, so it can represent any number up to 1020-1. So in any case the introduction of the soroban made it easier to conceive very large numbers. Buddhist angels and mustard seeds The story so far does not quite explain where those different systems came from or why these choices were made, and indeed earlier editions of the jinkōki used different combinations of kasū and chūsū. In any case, it turns out that the origin of these very large numbers lies in ancient Buddhist texts. Buddhism has the notion of a kalpa or aeon, a very long unit of time. There are in the old texts two definitions for a kalpa, provided by the Buddha by analogy. I found the following explanation on a Japanese web site for the book “巨大数入門” (“An introduction to very large numbers”): 『仏教では、とても長い時間を表すときに劫（こう）という時間の単位が使われます。「未来永劫」「億劫」「五劫のすり切れ」などの言葉は、ここから来ています。この「劫」には2通りの意味があり、1つ目は「磐石劫」で、四十里四方の大石を、いわゆる天人の羽衣で百年に一度払い、その大きな石が摩滅して無くなってもなお「一劫」の時間は終わらないと譬えています。 2つ目は「芥子劫」で、方四十里の城に小さな芥子粒を満たして百年に一度、一粒ずつ取り去り、その芥子がすべて無くなってもなお尽きないほどの長い時間が一劫であるとのことです。』 Loosely translated, this means that there are two definitions for a kalpa: Imagine a huge cube of rock of 40 ri on the side. Every hundred years, an angel brushes the rock with its wings. A kalpa won’t have ended by the time it takes to entirely wear away the rock. Imagine a huge building of 40 ri on the side. Every hundred years, a small mustard seed is put into it. The kalpa won’t have ended by the time the building is full. To estimate how long a kalpa actually lasts, someone made the following assumptions: Suppose the angel’s wings remove one layer of atoms over an area of one square meter. Given that 1 ri is 500 m and the diameter of an atom is 0.2 nm, it would take 4×1024 years to wear away the rock. For the second definition, assuming a mustard seed is 0.5 mm, it would take 6.4×1024 years to fill the entire volume. Suppose the angel’s wings remove one layer of atoms over an area of one square meter. Given that 1 ri is 500 m and the diameter of an atom is 0.2 nm, it would take 4×1024 years to wear away the rock. For the second definition, assuming a mustard seed is 0.5 mm, it would take 6.4×1024 years to fill the entire volume. It’s rather striking that both estimates produce the same order of magnitude, 1024 years. For comparison, the estimated age of the universe is “only” 1.38×1010 years. Grains of sand in the Ganges Regardless, it means that Buddhist scholar monks had a need to express very large numbers. In fact, Buddhism has concepts such as the number of grains of sand in the Ganges (gōgasha,恒河沙), which are even larger than goku (極, 1048). The largest quantified term I could find in my dictionary is muryōtaisū (無量大数,”immeasurably large number”), with a value of 1068 using chūsū, but often defined as 1088, due to a variant system used for values above goku used in the 1631 edition of the jinkōki. Fuss-free food Updated November 24, 2018 About Blog Terms About Blog Terms © 2024   Jekyll theme Skinny Bones","tags":"","url":"articles/japanese-large-numbers/index.html"}, {"title":"On puppets and being human","text":" On puppets and being human Ghost in the Shell is a series of Japanese animated movies (anime,アニメ) featuring cyborgs (“cybernetic organism”, in this case a human with both organic and robotic body parts). I was struck by the frequent references to puppets in several of the movies, and I want to explore the symbolism behind this. I will look in particular at the movies “Ghost in the Shell”, “Innocence” and “Solid State Society”, because in these movies the references are most clear. Familiarity with the movies is not required. Puppets, dolls, marionettes, mannequins I use the word puppet as the most general word. A doll to my mind is a puppet used as a child’s toy. A marionette is a puppet with strings to manipulate it. And a mannequin is a puppet in the sense that it is a representation of a human. I would say that the crucial property is that a puppet is somewhat articulated or can be made to move. In Japanese there are also several words for puppets and dolls. The most common word is ningyō, 人形 , “doll, puppet”. The word nin means person and gyō means form, shape. Specifically, ayatsuriningyō, 操り人形, sometimes shortened to just ayatsuri, 操り, means a puppet controlled by an operator, e.g. a marionette. The word ayatsuri means “manipulation”. The other word that is used in Ghost in the Shell is kairai or kugutsu, 傀儡, this is an older word and not so common (neither of the kanji is in common use). It is an interesting word because both its characters mean “puppet”. The first, 傀, is composed of “person” and “ghost”; the second is likely simply a variant, and is only used in this word. The reading kugutsu apparently derives from kugu, 久具, a plant from which the baskets were woven that were used to transport the puppets by itinerant puppet players. Cyberbrains and ghosts In the Ghost in the Shell series, one of the main themes that is being explored is what defines a human. A cyborg is a human with all or parts of its body replaced by artificial components. In the Ghost in the Shell universe, even the brain can be treated this way, being augmented by a cyberbrain (dennō,電脳), essentially an electronic system with a similar functionality, but connected to the net). In the most extreme case, the entire human brain is replaced by a cyberbrain which contains the content of the original human brain. By contrast, robots do not start out human. The difference between a robot and a full-cyborg human is only the origin of the data in the brain. In Ghost in the Shell, the word ghost is colloquial slang for an individual’s consciousness or soul, which is what sets it apart from a robot. Part of the plot of the second movie, “Innocence”, is that robots get a ghost through a process called “ghost dubbing”, i.e. copying the ghost from a human and putting it into the robot cyberbrain. This idea returns in the recent “Arise” series. A brief note on the characters In this article I will mention a few characters from the series who belong to a kind of special state intelligence unit called “Public Security Section 9” (公安９課): “The Major”, Motoko Kusanagi, a female cyborg, the main character in the series. Batō, a male cyborg, the protagonist in “Innocence”. Togusa, a human with a cyberbrain, the companion of Batō in “Innocence”. “The Major”, Motoko Kusanagi, a female cyborg, the main character in the series. Batō, a male cyborg, the protagonist in “Innocence”. Togusa, a human with a cyberbrain, the companion of Batō in “Innocence”. Furthermore, I mention a character from “The Individual Eleven” series, Hideo Kuze, a male cyborg, a very charismatic revolutionary. Ghost in the Shell (1995) In the first Ghost in the Shell movie, there is no strong symbolism of puppets, but there are several references. Project 2501 is a program that can stealthily manipulate politics and intelligence, altering databases and the memories in people’s cyberbrains. While traversing the net as it performed its tasks, Project 2501 acquired and processed so much information that it eventually achieved self-awareness. Its creators regarded this as a bug in the program. When Project 2501 realised that its programmers would try to kill it when they discovered it had become sentient, it devised a plan to ensure its own safety. When the manipulations of Project 2501 are discovered, they are initially assumed to be the work of an extremely skilled hacker, nicknamed the Puppet Master (人形使い,ningyoutsukai), presumably because it is a master manipulator and the people whose cyberbrains are hacked become effectively sock puppets. It is worth nothing that at the end of the movie, Project 2501 is assimilated into the cyberbrain of Motoko Kusanagi. So from a certain angle Kusanagi becomes the Puppet Master. A more oblique but to my mind more important puppet reference is the scene where Motoko Kusanagi rides on a passenger boat on the canals of Hong Kong. This is a long montage without dialogue. Kusanagi sees someone very much like herself at a table in a restaurant. Is it a human or a cyborg? She also looks at some mannequins in a shop window, and the scene ends with an empty shop with undressed, partially disassembled mannequins. You can’t help but think about how she must see a parallel between herself and these puppets. Innocence (2004) The second Ghost in the Shell movie, “Innocence”, is where the puppet symbolism is present most strongly. The main reference to puppets in Ghost in the Shell “Innocence” is an implicit one: the title song is called the Puppet Song, of which I wrote in an earlier article. The full title of the song is kugutsu-uta: uramite chiru (傀儡謡「怨恨みて 散る」, くぐつうた「うらみてちる」) which means “Puppet song: The flowers resentfully fall”. The theme of the song is mortality. It is used a few times in the movie, but most prominently in the opening scene, which shows the creation of a humanoid robot, and in the parade scene, which is based on a Taiwanese Buddhist temple procession and involves giant puppet-like figures. There is another reference, one that I found particularly interesting. After the parade scene, Togusa sees the following poem written on a wall: 生死去来 棚頭傀儡 一線断時 落落磊磊 The writing order is top to bottom, right to left, and it is an archaic and poetic form of Japanese without hiragana. Togusa reads it in full as: 生死の去来するは、 棚頭の傀儡たり。 一線断ゆる時、 落落磊磊。 せいしのきょらいするは、 ほうとうのかいらいたり、<b いっせんたゆるとき、 らくらくらいらい seishi no kyorai suru wa, hōtō no kairai tari, issen tayuru toki, rakuraku rairai. In the dubbed version, this is translated as: “Life and death come and go like marionettes dancing on a table. Once their strings are cut, they easily crumble.” The rakuraku rairai is particularly poetic. raku means to fall down; rai means a heap of stones, the kanji 磊 is stone 石 repeated three times. Hence the overall meaning of crumble. Curiously, the word 磊磊落落 (rairairakuraku) also exists; it means “openhearted; unaffected; free and easy”. The original author of this poem is a Buddhist monk called Getsuan Soukou (月庵宗光), who lived 1326－1389, during the The Nanboku-chō period (南北朝時代). He used it in one of his sermons. The poem got included in a famous treatise on Noh theatre, “A Mirror of the Flower” (Kakyō, 花鏡) by Zeami Motokiyo (世阿弥 元清) (1363–1443), who was the son of Kan’ami Kiyotsugu. Together they are considered the founders of Noh. Noh theatre is a form of classical Japanese theatre with music, poetry and dance. It is still regularly performed today, and has a similar status to opera in Western society. In Ghost in the Shell there are occasional references to Noh, in particular in “The Individual Eleven” where Hideo Kuze has a lengthy monologue about the origins of Noh and how it was cherished by the samurai class. Zeami’s work “A Mirror of the Flower” deals amongst other topics with the link between marionettes and Noh theatre actors. The work has been translated into English (and you can read it for free) and I found in it a closer (and perhaps better) translation of the poem: “Birth and death, goings and comings: A marionette in play. When one string snaps, It falls and collapses.” The comment by Zeami is quite interesting: “This [poem] exemplifies the condition of humans who act out the cycle of birth-and-death. Although the manipulation of an artificial figure upon the boards [of a puppet stage] may [make it] appear as all sorts of things, it is not really an object that moves [of its own will]. It is [the result of] the play of manipulated strings. Cut these strings and it collapses – such is the spirit [of this poem].” There is also an interesting footnote: “This poem appears in Gettan Osho Hogo (月庵和尚法語,’[Rinzai Zen] Priest Gettan’s Talks on Buddhist Principles’), a late 14th-century text. Zeami’s subsequent interpretation of the poem as descriptive of the relation between the actor’s mind and the ‘illusion’ of character that it creates differs from the Zen intent of the poem, which admonishes the reader to break free from the trap of the illusory world of ‘birth-and-death’.” But considering the argument presented before the poem, what Zeami means is that as soon as the actor loses this ultimate state of awareness, the acting will collapse. Zeami argues that when the actor achieves the ultimate state of awareness, he realizes how his mind can be used to create the illusion of reality that he presents to his audience with a detachment and skill associated with a master puppeteer. In other words, the actor on the stage is the puppet manipulated by the actor’s mind. This is a very powerful concept, and closely related to the type of Buddhist meditation that focuses on existing in the moment. It is likely also why Noh appealed to the samurai. Within the context of Ghost in the Shell, this concept gets an extended meaning, not restricted to the mind and body of a human. Any self-aware entity controlling a humanoid form can be considered in this way. The question is why this poem figures so prominently in the movie, but specifically in the scenes to do with the place where the robots are created (Etorofu, one of the Kuril Islands). The two main characters, Batō and Togusa, go there to interview a powerful hacker, Kim, who is obsessed with dolls and clockwork and who has transfered his own ghost into a puppet-like robot. Clearly, Kim is the one fascinated by this poem, as every appearance of it is connected to him. Generalizing Zeami’s view of the poem, I am inclined to interpret the strings in the poem as the connection between the robots and the mind that controls them. In a key scene, the protagonist Batō enters the factory ship where the robots are made. He is attacked by an army of robots programmed remotely to fight him. Motoko Kusanagi hacks one of them and downloads her ghost into it, and fights on his side. She then gains control of the ship’s central computer, at which point all the robots except the one she controls collapse: their threads have been cut. This is a recurrent theme in Ghost in the Shell, for example in “Solid State Society” something very similar happens. But perhaps more significant is the fact that to Batō, who clearly has missed the Major deeply since she disappeared at the end of the first movie, three years ago, immediately identifies the robot with her. As the robots on the ship are not dressed, he puts his jacket on her. And this despite the fact that the robot has no facial expression and looks identical to the others. When the Major disconnects from the robot, it also collapses. But Batō now knows that the ghost of the Major is always around. And as if not to leave any doubt about the importance of the puppets in the movie, the final scene ends with a close-up of a doll held by Togusa’s daughter. Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex – Solid State Society (2006) Right at the start of this third movie, there is a reference to “the Puppet Master”. The Major listens in to a conversation where the nickname is used, and comments “The Puppet Master? Not a bad name!”. Note that in Japanese the word is different from in the first movie: instead of ningyōtsukai 人形遣い it is kugutsumawashi 傀儡廻; kugutsu is a different reading for kairai, 傀儡, the word for puppet used in the poem in Innocence. The word mawashi, 廻, means “to go around”, and kugutsumawashi refers to wandering puppet players who went from village to village. Because of the different word choice, it is in the original Japanese version less obvious that there could be a link with the Puppet Master in the first movie.There is a however a clear link with the second movie because of the word kugutsu, which is lost in the English version. As in the first movie, the initial assumption is that this Puppet Master must be some top-wizard-level hacker (超ウィザード級ハッカー); then the suspicion grows that it might be some distributed program which might have achieved some degree of self-awareness. But considering the first movie, it should come as no surprise that there is a connection with the Major. Early on we see the Major operating many different cyber bodies remotely, even several at once. At one point, she tries to control one too many and one of them collapses, and she remarks: 同時に義体を操るのは、2体迄が限界ね tōji ni gitai wo ayatsuru no wa, nitai made ga genkai ne The English subtitles say “Controlling two prosthetic bodies at the same time is apparently my limit”. The word gitai,義体, is closer translated as cyber body; the word used for controlling is ayatsuru,操る, exactly the word for manipulating a puppet. And there is a scene where one of the Major’s remote cyber bodies deactivates during a conversation, leading the person talking to it to comment, “Huh, that’s a puppet as well?”. Bonus: stills of the puppet poem in “Innocence” The first occurrence of the poem is after the parade scene: It also appears on the wall of Kim’s study: After Togusa narrowly escapes an attack on his cyberbrain : When Batō and the Major manage to take control of the factory ship: Free: Filimon, Luiza Maria. “Dolls, Offsprings, and Automata.

It’s set on an island but the community there is otherwise quite similar to mainland Japan. Things disappear from the community’s life, and people forget about them. They don’t simply disappear. For example, when the “perfume” disappears , people pour out their perfume bottles in the river. Then they forget that perfume ever existed. And when “birds” disappear, people set free their caged birds, and totally forget all about birds. The book centres on three characters: the narrator (watashi わたし, “I”), the old man (ojii-san おじいさん, jii is old man and o and san are honorifics) and the narrator’s editor, “R” (R-shi, shi 氏 is a formal form of referring to a person, typically someone one is not close with). I started reading near the end of February and it took me three months to read the novel in Japanese, reading a few pages most evenings. I would recommend this book because it is very taught-provoking. Although nothing really bad happens explicitly, it is a very sad story. The book has 28 chapters and the real turning point is by the end of Chapter 25. It’s very beautifully written, with a great eye for small details and remarkable control over specificity: early on, the setting of the story seems very generic but as the book progresses, there are more specific Japanese cultural references; towards the end they disappear again. I really like the way the author expresses e.g. unease of a character by describing how he keeps putting his feet into his slippers and pulling them back out, or the details about the type of shoe that makes a specific sound, so you can tell the wearer is a young woman, etc. In the title in Japanese hisoyaka means quiet, still, surreptitious; kesshou means crystal or crystallisation but also fruits of labour etc. So it is “Quiet crystallisation”. (The French title is “Cristallisation secrète”.) According to the afterword, the Yoko Ogawa was thinking of “crystallised” memories we carry inside us. The English title puts the focus on the Memory Police themselves but they are not the focus of the novel. The problem with the English title is that it leads the reader to expect some totalitarian political novel, which it is not. The memory police serve as a cause for fear because of their control of the population, but that is not the point at all. To my mind, the novel is really about the acceptance of loss. Loss of memories, loss of many good things in life, loss of loved ones, loss of abilities. Issues of translation from Japanese I am increasingly interested in issues of translation from Japanese. Reading a Japanese novel does not require full translation, because I don’t need to turn a Japanese sentence into an English one (or a Dutch one, as that is my native tongue) to understand it. I’ve written a few blog posts on reading Japanese, especially as a learner. But while reading this novel I did think a lot about how it could be translated. What is peculiar in this novel is that there are hardly any typically Japanese elements. It could be set anywhere. Mentions of food are very unspecific; people drink coffee, black tea or cocoa and sometimes wine. Even terms that could have been specific such as the mention of an altar to the sea gods in an old ferry, are not: the word used is umi no kamisama no saidan 海の神様の祭壇 rather than the more common Shinto term watatzumi no kamidana 海神の神棚. There are the typically Japanese politeness levels and honorary pre- and suffixes, but if I were to translate it, I would not try to emulate them. Especially the old man is very polite, and always refers to the narrator as ojousama お嬢様, a very formal way of saying “Miss”. The word used for clothes is youfuku 洋服, Western clothes, but I feel that is purely for the benefit of the Japanese audience, so I would just translate it as “clothes”. The climate is definitely not Scotland but not specifically Japan either, nor is the vegetation that is mentioned. So it is carefully unspecific, at least in the initial chapters. It made me wonder if there was any benefit at all in reading it in Japanese. The translation is excellent, it was shortlisted for the Booker Prize 2020. And yet, I find the Japanese very beautiful and I think impossible to convey entirely in translation. The translator, Stephen Snyder, says in an interview: “Yoko Ogawa’s prose in Japanese is extraordinarily beautiful, so it’s always a challenge to try to find a way to capture even a vague sense of that beauty in English.” And I just like reading Japanese, slowly. While reading I noted down some typical Japanese cultural elements that caught my eye. (Indented sentences are quotes. English quotes in italics are from the translation by Stephen Snyder, other translations are mine.) For about the first quarter of the novel, there are no Japan-specific references, but then, in Chapter 6, with the disappearance of the roses, there was one after all: primary school kids with randoseru ランドセル , firm-sided school backpacks made of leather. A less specific word would have been 学生鞄 gakusei kaban (school bag). The word randoseru derives from the Dutch “ransel”; they are very typical for Japanese schoolkids. Still, when I was in primary school in Flanders, I had one too, with a slightly different shape, wider and less deep; we just called it “boekentas” (book bag). I loved the sound the clasps made. And when you ran with it on, the books and pens etc would rattle inside, which is exactly what the writer describes as well: The children took off running along the river, their backpacks rattling behind them. kodomotachi ha RANDOSERU wo narashinagara, nagare wo oikakete itta. And another, perhaps less obvious, cultural reference, occurs at the start of Chapter 7: At the base of the bridge next to my laundry platform stood an elegantly dressed woman. “What lovely roses,” I told her.This was the first thing that came to mind. sentakujo ni kakaru hashi no tamoto ni mo, okanemochi fuu no fujin ga hitori, tatazunde ita.“kihin no aru bara desu ne” watashi ha itta.sore de futo atama ni ukanda shoushokugo wo, sono mama kuchi ni shita no datta. The “What lovely roses” in Japanese is “kihin no aru bara desu ne” (what elegant roses), and the narrator comments on her random choice of “kihin no aru” with the term shoushokugo 修飾語 which is the general grammatical term for “modifier” (she is after all a novelist). That is because it is an adjectival sentence rather than an adjective (“roses that have elegance”). Once her work was done, she turned and, without a glance at the stream, gave me the sort of graceful bow typical of people of her class and left. subete no sagyou ga owaru to fujin ha, kawa no nagare wo me de oikake you to mo sezu, jouryuukaikyuu no hito dokutoku no yuttari shita ojigi wo shite, watashi kara hanarete itta. The “graceful bow” is a jiki 辞儀, a bow accompanying a greeting, rather than rei 礼, a bow to thank someone. The narrator uses the words jouryuukaikyuu no hito 上流階級の人 (upper class person) and yuttari to shita ゆったりとした (easy, leisurely) bow. In Chapter 8, where R visits the narrator’s mother’s workshop in the basement, the narrator recalls her mother eating iriko イリコ (also written 炒り子). This is quite specific: the term is only used in the West of Japan (and also in Hawaii, because of immigrants from Western Japan). It refers to Japanese anchovy fry (kataguchi-iwashi, 片口鰯), boiled in brine and then dried. In the rest of Japan they are called niboshi or jako. The writer was born in Okayama, Okayama Prefecture in Kansai, so that is probably why she uses the word iriko rather than niboshi. To translate it in a culturally context-free way, you could of course just say dried anchovies. “My mother always kept dried sardines wrapped in newspaper on the desk in her studio, and she would snack on them as she worked.” haha ha shigotoba no tsukue ni, itsumo shinbungami ni kurunda IRIKO wo oite itandesu. sore wo MUSHAMUSHA tabenagara shigoto wo shite ita no. In Chapter 13, the narrator is at the head office of the secret police and talking to a kind of receptionist. She says 「差し入れ」 (“sashiire”) and the person she’s talking to says 「さしいれ？」(“sashiire?”). The word 差し入れ (sashi-ire) has the following meanings: (1) Insertion, letter drop. (2) Things sent to a prisoner. (3) Supply of provisions, refreshments, etc. to someone carrying out a task. In the novel the meaning is clearly “Things sent to a prisoner” The subtext is that the receptionist pretends not to understand this word (because of course the secret police does not take prisoners). The use of hiragana for this word normally written in kanji makes that very clear, but is difficult to bring across in translation: use of italics or quotes do not have quite the same effect. “I have a package I’d like to have delivered to an acquaintance…” My voice trailed off, echoing from the ceiling before being lost in the vastness of the hall. “Package?” He paused, twirling his pen in his fingers, and repeated the word as though trying to recall the meaning of some rarely used philosophical term. In the second chapter of the novel, the narrator refers to her father’s documents about birds with containing “”鳥”という 字” (“tori” to iu ji). You can translate that as “the word ‘bird’, but although ji can mean “word”, it usually means “character” and is anyhow more specific than kotoba (word). When they came upon something they considered dangerous—in other words, anything that contained the word “bird”—they threw the item unceremoniously on the floor. kiken to minasareta mono ha – tsumari nanika hitotsu demo “tori” to iu ji ga mitsukatta mono ha – dondon yuka ni　hourinagerarete itta. In the third chapter there is a scene of the narrator writing a novel, and she describes the typical genkouyoushi 原稿用紙, i.e “paper for manuscripts”, Japanese writing paper lined with a square grid, one square per character. Of course as a translator you could just say “writing paper”. But in Chapter 14 there is a scene where the narrator, still in the HQ of the secret police, mentions specifically that someone is writing using the alphabet (arufabetto アルファベット ): His papers were thickly covered with numbers and letters in a script I did not understand. shorui ni ha imi no yoku wakaranai suuji ya ARUFABETTO ga, bisshiri kakikonde atta. If I would have translated the earlier kanji-specific terms in a generic way, then I would have to say Whereas if I had been specific about the earlier writing being in kanji, I could translate It does not matter much of course, but in the latter case the story would be more clearly set in Japan than in the former. As an aside, Japanese has many words with the structure like the word bisshiri びっしり (densely written) used in that sentence: four hiragana characters, the second a small tsu っ which indicates a glottal stop, and the last one ri り. For example, bikkuri　(surprised, frightened), tappuri (plentiful), sappari (feeling refreshed) etc.　Someone at made an attempt to enumerate them and counted 158 of them. The National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics says that 103 of these words with pattern AっBり are onomatopoeic and mimetic words. Japanese has about two thousand of these onomatopoeic and mimetic words; there are many forms but the most common is ABAB (like wakuwaku わくわく, nervous, trembling, excited; or mushamusha ムシャムシャ, munching); the pattern ABり (like shikiri しきり, frequent, continual) is also quite common. Yoko Ogawa makes liberal use of such words and it is one of the aspects that is hard to convey in translation, especially the mimetic words. At the end of Chapter 13 is a very specific Japanese cultural reference, the mention of baumukuuhen バウムクーヘン, “Baumkuchen”. This is a kind of cake of German origin that looks like a cross-section of a tree trunk with a hole in the middle, as it is baked on a spit. It is very popular in Japan. I used to buy them in the konbini to have with my coffee. And it is specifically popular as a gift to guests at weddings, which is exactly the case in the novel. “My parents had come home from the wedding, but neither of them seemed to realize that I’d slept the entire day. They were animated and wanted me to taste the cake they had brought home from the reception.” “ryoushin ga kekkonshiki kara kaette kitandesu. futari tomo watashi ga nemuritsdzukete ita koto ni, kidzuki mo shimasen deshita. saa, omiyage no BAUMUKUUHEN wo tabemashou nante, ukiuki shite iru data nandesu” If as a translator I wanted to avoid the cultural reference I could replace it by “wedding cake”, and that would at least work in Anglo-Saxon countries. In other countries where guests don’t get to take a piece of cake home (like in Flanders), the text gives me a way out because it refers to the Baumkuchen as omiyage (お土産, local specialty or souvenir bought as a gift while travelling) so I could simply call it “the local speciality cake” or something similar.　 On the whole, if I were to translate this novel, I think I would prefer to keep the few Japanese cultural references as they are. It would fit better with other culturally specific elements such as the politeness levels, which it would be rather a shame to remove entirely in translation. Japanese has a lot of loanwords that are written in katakana. Most of them are from American English, to the extent that it is a running joke that you can speak Japanese with only katakana-English. I am generally more interested in the katakana loanwords that are not from English. In this novel there are quite a few. I already mentioned randoseru and baumukuuhen. Other examples are mesu メス from Dutch “mes” – Japanese meaning “scalpel”, Dutch meaning knife; kokku コック from Dutch “kok”, “cook”; karute カルテ from German Karte – Japanese meaning “clinical record”, German meaning “card”; and noruma ノルマ from Russian “norma” – Japanese meaning “quota”, Russian meaning “norm”. I like such words because they relate to Japan’s history, for example Japan imported the German medical system in the 19th century; the Baumkuchen were created by a German baker, an ex-prisoner-of-war, for the Hiroshima Prefectural Commercial Exhibition in 1919. The Dutch words are even older as they were one of the few nations allowed to trade with Japan in the Tokugawa era (early 1600s), together with the Portuguese from which amongst others パン “pan”, bread was loaned. In the novel, the bread is usually ロールパ roorupan which means “breadroll”, the rooru (roll) borrowed from English, or furansupan フランスパン “French bread”. In common Japanese, the most common word is shokupan 食パン which is typically a white square loaf; shoku just means “food”. An English loanword that is interesting from a translation perspective is ショートケーキ shootokeeki, “shortcake”, because this is a typical American cake also popular in Japan. If I were translate this novel into Dutch with Japanese cultural references I would leave it as “shortcake”; but it’s a type of cake not so well known in Flanders so otherwise I would probably use “gâteau” as that is a similar cake for a Flemish audience. (And yes, that is a loanword from French into Flemish.) If there was still any doubt about the Japanese setting of the novel, the following sentence in Chapter 16 puts an end to that: Even if we couldn’t recall the exact date, I knew that his came around every year just as the cherry blossoms were budding out. I was quite certain that time was fast approaching. nittsuke ha omoidasenakute, mainen sakura ga wazuka ni hirakihajimeru kisetsu datta koto ha tashika de, sorosoro sou iu jiki ga chikadzuite kita tou iu yokan ha machigainaku suru no datta. The sakura, cherry blossoms, are quintessentially Japanese. In Chapter 16, another nice loanword appears, again from Dutch: orugooru オルゴール from “orgel”, meaning music box. The word “orgel” literally means organ. The mechanism for music boxes were initially based on the barrel organ, “draaiorgel” in Dutch. According to Kotobank, the first mention in Japanese is in a publication from 1750. The scene where this orugooru is introduced is one of my favourite scenes in the novel. Such a nice description of the emotions that listening to the melody played by a music box evokes. It is all the more poignant because the narrotor and the old man have no memory of music boxes anymore. This is one of the two Japanese words kept in the English translation: “It’s not really magic,” R said. “It’s an orugooru.” “majutsu da nante oogesa na mono ja arimasen. kore ha ORUGOORU desu” R-shi ga itta. In Chapter 19, there is an explicit reference to Japan: washitsu 和室, Japanese-style room. The character 和 (wa) means both harmony, peace and Japan, Japanese-style. Needless to say, I offered them the Japanese-style room on the first floor, as far as possible from the hidden room. mochiron watashi ha ikkai no washitsu – kakushiheya kara ichiban tooi heya – wo teikyou ageta. The story behind the use of this character to mean Japan is quite interesting. Long ago, Japan was called Yamato. Originally, that was a region in what is now Nara prefecture, where the first capital was. Eventually it came to mean all of Japan. (Later it came to be called Nihon (日本) but that’s another story; as is why it’s called “Japan” in English.) From the 3th century CE, the Japanese adopted the Chinese writing system and until the 7th century, “Yamato” was written 倭, the character the Chinese had been using for a long time to refer to the inhabitants of the Japanese islands. As I explained earlier, most kanji have two types of readings, “onyomi”, which is based on the Japanese rendition of the ancient Chinese pronunciation of a character, and kunyomi, which is the native Japanese reading. The kunyomi for 倭　is yamato; the onyomi is wa. Then at the start of the Nara period, in 713 CE, the empress Genmei decreed that Yamato (and in fact all important place names) should be written with two “auspicious characters”. Therefore 倭 was prefixed with the character 大, “great”. So it became 大倭, pronounced in full Ooyamato but usually just Yamato. Then, for reasons lost in time, later in the Nara period, 倭 became replaced with 和 which has the same onyomi (wa), but also means “peace, harmony”. Both writings coexisted for a long time but eventually 大和 became the preferred writing. And so now 和 wa is used to mean “Japanese”. In Chapter 20, the narrator writes out a series of characters. The sequence she writes is the first two rows of the standard organisation for the Japanese syllabary, a table with ten rows and five columns, one colum for each vowel sound and one row for each starting consonant. To warm up my fingers, I tried writing a, i, u, e, o. Then, taking care to match the size of the characters to the lines on the paper, I continued with ka, ki, ku, ke, ko. yubinarashi no tame ni sasho, a, i, u, e, o to kaite miru. masume to ji no ookisa no BARANSU wo tashikamenagara, ka, ki, ku, ke, ko to tsudzukeru. The word masume means a square on Japanese manuscript paper. In the later chapters, there are more specifically Japanese references, for example in Chapter 22, there is a mention of おはじき ohajiki, a traditional Japanese children’s game similar to marbles, played with coin-shaped pieces made of coloured glass or plastic. So I sounded out the children’s songs my nurse had taught me or the tune we had used to count for tiddlywinks. shikatanai de, mukashi baayasan ga utatte kureta komoriuta ya, ohajiki no kazoeuta wo tadatadashiku fuita. There is also a mention of　ramune ラムネ, fizzy soda candy, a typical Japanese type of candy. This is the only other place in the novel where the translator has kept a Japanese word. “Is it medicine?” I asked. “No, it’s called ramune. I’m impressed that your mother tried to preserve something as ordinary as this.” “nanika no kusuri kashira” watashi ha itta.“iiya. RAMUNE da yo. kimi no okaasan ha konna sasayaka no mono made, daiji ni totteitanda ne” And further: “It’s a lemon-flavored candy. When we were children, all the stores sold them and there were countless ramune on the island, but now there are only these few left here.” “satoukashi sa. kodomo no goro ha omise ni ikurademo utteita. touchuu ni ha kazoekirenaikurai no RAMUNE ga atta. demo ima nokotte iru no ha, koko ni aru suutsubu dake da” The Japanese word satoukashi 砂糖菓子 means simply “sugar candy”. Chapter 23 features a train journey. Train is normally densha 電車 which literally means “electric vehicle”, but the novel always uses kisha 汽車 “train, esp. long distance, but originally steam train” (ki means steam). And as it mentions a whistle, I think it is actually a steam train. The other word used is ressha 列車 the term for “train” used by the railway companies; retsu means “file”, so it is literally a file of cars. There are mentions of several types trains: kyuukou 急行 “express” and tokkyuu 特急 “limited express” (faster than an express) and also of the kaisatsuguchi 改札口, ticket gates. Trains are of course universal but this terminology is quite specific to the Japanese railway system. Also, for me personally, it evokes memories of taking the train in Japan. In Chapter 24 there is a beautiful description of the hands of the old man, with a list of objects his hands had made. I have always loved his hands, from the time I was a little girl. They could make almost anything: a toy box, a plastic model, a cage for a rhinoceros beetle, a beanbag, a desk lamp, a bicycle seat cover, smoked fish, an apple cake. kodomo no goro kara, watashi ha ojiisan no te ga suki datta. minna de issho ni dekakeru toki ha, itsudemo ojiisan no te wo tusnaida. sore ha omochabako, jidousha no PURAMODERU ya, KABUTOmushi no shiikubako ya, otedama ya, deki SUTANDO ya, jitensha no SADORUKABAA ya, sakana no kunsei ya, RINGOKEEKI ya, tonikaku nandemo tsukuridasu koto ga dekiru. Some of these are very typical: カブト虫の飼育箱 kabutomushi no shiikubako, a cage for rearing a Japanese rhinoceros beetle;　お手玉 otedama (translated above as “beanbag”) are balls of colourful fabric filled with rice or beans. There is a small phrase left untranslated: minna de issho ni dekakeru toki ha, itsudemo ojiisan no te wo tusnaida It doesn’t work so well in English because for the narrator, ojiisan is a term of endearment, and “the old man” does not carry that connotation. All in all, there are very few explicit Japanese cultural references in the original novel, only about one for every two chapters. It’s interesting to see that the English translation keeps enough of them that the Japanese setting of the novel is still clear to the attentive reader.
