All of these are actually very easy. Cooking rice Cooking rice is very easy. The basic rule is: use 2 cups water for 1 cup rice (for Basmati a little less than 2 cups, for Japanese rice it is 1.1 cup water for 1 cup rice). The cup I use is 200 ml. I wash the rice a few times to get rid of dust and also of the rice flour from polishing. For Japanese rice, you should not just rinse it but also actually “wash” the rice by gently rubbing the grains together between your fingers. A detailed explanation can be found at Makiko Itoh’s site Just Hungry. To cook the 1 cup of rice in the microwave: Put the rice with the water in a microwave-compatible pot with a lid Cook at full power (900W) for one and a half minutes Cook at reduced power (40%, 360W) for 15 minutes. For basmati or Japanese rice this is enough; wholegrain rice takes more time, about 25 minutes. Check if all the water is gone, if not give it another 5 minutes, then check again. To cook the 1 cup of rice on the hob: Put the rice with the water in pot with a lid Bring to the boil Cook over low heat for about 15-20 minutes. For basmati or Japanese rice this is enough; wholegrain rice takes about 25-30 minutes.

Cooking potatoes If you use the microwave, cooking potatoes is again very easy: Wash the potatoes and cut out any eyes or damaged parts, but don’t peel them. You can either cook large potatoes whole or chop them up into small chunks. If you like them whole, pierce them several times with a fork. Put in the microwave at full power for about 10 minutes (for 500g potatoes). Check if they are ready by pricking with a fork or just tasting. If they are not ready, give it another 5 minutes, then check again. Wash the potatoes and cut out any eyes or damaged parts, but don’t peel them.

You can of course cook them on the hob as well but the microwave is a better option, it is quicker and the cooked potatoes taste better too. Cooking pasta Pasta is one of the few foods that I do not cook in the microwave, because you need a large pot with plenty of water. My approach is a bit different from what most other people do, but again very easy: Bring 2 l of water to the boil with a bit of salt (say 1/2 tsp) When the water is boiling heavily, add the pasta (100 g per person) and stir until all the pasta is submerged. Cook for 3 minutes in heavily boiling water, without a lid. Take the pot off the hob, put the lid on and let it stand for the remainder of the time indicated on the package. For example if the cooking time on the package says 12 minutes (quite typical), then leave it for 9 minutes. Strain, sprinkle with some olive oil and serve.

So I had to go and buy everything — great fun when you’re jet-lagged. I went to a supermarket and bought amongst other things a very sharp knife (partly showing on the banner of the recipes page), a great versatile microwave pot (featuring on the banner of my post about the microwave), and the cheap-but-beautiful black-and-red bowls. I also bought three kitchen tools that I particularly like: A flexible, antibacterial cutting mat This mat contains a phytoncide, an antibacterial organic compound derived from plants. To kill all the germs you simply put it in the microwave for a minute. And it can go in the dishwasher as well. You can buy it on line, just search for “phytoncide cutting board”. A pair of bamboo cooking chopsticks Long chopsticks are great for cooking pasta or noodles. No risk of burning your fingers and handier than a fork too. You can easily find plain ones but I liked the sakura decoration (cherry blossoms), and it actually has ridges for a better grip. A rice scoop Japanese rice is different from other rice in the way it sticks together: when properly cooked, each grain is still quite firm but the grains have a sticky outer layer. That’s why every Japanese kitchen has a rice scoop like this, with little nobs that stop the rice from sticking to it. The scoop can be put upright on its handle, very nifty!

I had always been very interested in Japan, so this was a great opportunity. I started planning a research visit, and at that point I thought it would be better to learn some Japanese. So about three months before the trip I started my first Japanese lesson. Fortunately, nobody told me one should not attempt to learn a new language over the age of forty. And anyone who has learned some Japanese will appreciate how ridiculously short a time three months is; luckily I didn’t know any better. In any case, I started learning very basic Japanese and I loved it: the writing system, the grammar, the culture as expressed through the language. Learning your first kanji (Chinese characters used in Japanese) is a great experience, because kanji are mysterious, beautiful and concise – and you think you can see the logic to it. And learning the first phrases makes you feel it won’t be all that hard. It’s wonderful. Because of the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, I had to postpone my trip. But in the summer of 2012, having learned Japanese for a bit more than a year, I went to Kyoto for a two-month research visit. And it was amazing: kanji everywhere! Somewhere along the path, learning Japanese had become a goal in its own right, not just a practical tool for survival in the wild. It was that as well, of course – just try shopping in a Japanese supermarket without knowing any Japanese. So I conversed in broken Japanese, and looked up kanji on my phone (and was surprised how many signs said “dentist”), and tried to improve my hiragana and katakana reading skills. I didn’t actively study, the total immersion was all I wanted. At that time I had learned only basic grammar and sentence structure, very little informal Japanese – my teacher does not hold with that – and about 100 of the 500 most frequent kanji. I quickly discovered that “most frequent” does not really mean “common” or vice versa. The “most frequent kanji” list is based on newspaper articles, so there are many common kanji that are not in that list. Also, “knowing” or “having learned” a kanji is a rather vague term, and being able to tick them off in a spaced repetition app like Anki or Memrise (great tools though they are!) does not mean you know the meaning of a word consisting of “known” kanji, let alone its pronunciation. Kanji typically have several meanings, sometimes wildly different (e.g. 洗　means both “wash” and “inquire into”) and several readings, some based on the original Chinese pronunciation of the character, some on the Japanese pronunciation of the meaning of the character (e.g. 明日 “tomorrow” can be read as “ashita”, “asu” or “myonichi”). So there is a lot to learn. By now I was hooked, by both the language and the country. Two more years of study later I visited Japan again. On that visit I bought the paperback version of Haruki Murakami’s “1Q84”. It comes in 6 volumes, each about 400 pages. I started reading it on my return (October 2014). It is a slow process because really my Japanese is by far not good enough. I continuously encounter kanji that I have not learned yet or already forgotten, so I have to look them up. Luckily I can do this on my phone, by writing them stroke by stroke. It is now April 2016 and I have reached page 295 (of 357) in the first volume. At this rate, it will take me another 15 years to finish the book. This may not seem very encouraging. However, I hope of course that my reading skills will improve. And in fact I have found reading this way to be more enjoyable than reading the book in English translation: reading Japanese requires a deeper concentration and I feel more immersed in the story – and I find the Japanese writing simply beautiful. The books have also inspired me to make a few “Murakami meals”, which I’ll be posting soon. Speaking of food, I also bought a Zen temple cuisine cookbook, available in Japanese only. It gives a unique insight in the Zen way of cooking – and the language and vocabulary are much easier than Murakami’s. I’d like to thank my teacher Rie Ogura for her patience with me, waiting endlessly while I fumble for the right words.

(It’s now July 2016 and I’ve finally finished the first volume!) This post is about reading Japanese. I’ll give some tips on how to look up kanji and a few handy rules to simplify the reading process. I haven’t really encountered these tips and rules as such in my learning materials, so I thought they may be of interest to other learners as well. When learning to read in a language that uses an alphabet, you can simply look up any word you don’t know in a dictionary. Because of the use of kanji (漢字, Chinese characters), things are more complicated for the learner of Japanese. Words written in katakana or hiragana (the sets of about fifty characters used to write Japanese phonetically) are easy to look it up. But what to do with kanji? There are about two thousand kanji in general use. Learning them all takes a long time: in the Japanese school system, it takes nine years. Typically each kanji has several possible readings (pronunciation) and meanings. And knowing every meaning of every kanji does not mean knowing the meaning of words that use combinations of kanji. For me, reading for learning is different from ordinary reading. Normally, I read to understand the meaning of a text. When learning Japanese, I also want to learn the readings of the kanji I encounter and I want to practise recall of the kanji and compound words that I’ve already learnt. Usually I make a first pass through a page of the text without looking anything up, trying to remember as much as possible, both readings and meanings, and to guess at readings and meanings of compound words where possible. Very often the context helps to guess at meanings, so I make sure to read enough text to get sufficient context. Then in a second pass I look up every kanji for which I don’t know either the reading or the meaning, and every compound word that I don’t know. I find that the most convenient way to look up a kanji is an electronic dictionary on a smartphone, because I need to know just one of the readings. If I don’t know any of the readings, I use three different ways, depending on the kanji. All of them require understanding of the basics of kanji writing and structure: the stroke order, stroke count and the “radicals”, the kanji building blocks that make up the more complex kanji. The first way is to draw the kanji stroke by stroke. I prefer this approach as a learner, because I tend to remember the kanji better if I’ve had to write it. Typically, a kanji writing app will present a list of kanji that match the handwritten one. If my writing was good, I’ll get the kanji I was looking for on the first page. The second approach is to look up the kanji by radical. Most electronic dictionaries offer that facility. It usually works well if the radicals making up the kanji are clear. It really helps to know how to count the strokes in a radical, because they are usually ordered by stroke count. My final way is to use a (paper) dictionary with the SKIP (System of Kanji Indexing by Patterns) system for ordering kanji. I have the well-known “Kodansha Kanji Learner’s Dictionary”. The SKIP method is based on first classifying the kanji into one of 4 groups (Left-Right ◧, Up-Down ⬒, Enclosure ◻, and Solid ◼). For the first two categories, further indexing is by stroke count of both parts. Kanji in the third category (enclosure) are indexed by the number of sides of the enclosure. Kanji in the last category typically can’t always be broken down, but there aren’t that many of them and most of them are simple kanji. The first way is to draw the kanji stroke by stroke.

Kanji in the last category typically can’t always be broken down, but there aren’t that many of them and most of them are simple kanji. Although the many readings and meanings may sound horribly complicated, I found that there are actually a few general rules that simplify the reading process. Of course there are exceptions to all of these rules but they hold most of the time. Kanji have typically two types of readings, called on (音,”sound”) and kun (訓,”instruction” or “explanation”). The on-reading is based on the sound of the original Chinese reading of a character; the kun-reading is the Japanese word with the same meaning. Chinese used to play a similar role as Latin or Greek in ancient Japan, so in a way on-readings are comparable with words with a Latin or Greek root in English. The first general rule is that kanji appearing on their own (i.e. not in combination with other kanji) have almost always the kun-reading. For example, for the kanji 食, it will be one of the four kun-readings (く.う “ku-u”, く.らう “ku-rau”, た.べる “ta-beru” or は.む “ha-mu”), not one of the on-readings. To select the correct kun-reading, look at the hiragana following the kanji so 食う is pronounced as “kuu” and 食べる is pronounced as “taberu”. The second general rule is that in a compound word, all kanji have either the on- or the kun-reading. And for the vast majority of the compound words, it will be the on-reading. For example, 食事 is shokuji (on-on), not “ta-ji” (kun-on) or “shoku-koto” (on-kun). Generally, there are fewer on-readings than kun-readings for a kanji, and on-readings are also mostly single-syllable. Although there are indeed many on- and kun-readings, for most kanji one of each will be the most frequently used, and the others will likely be used only in fixed combinations. The same is true for meanings: usually one of the meanings is used much more frequently than all the others.

Combined with fried paneer (Indian fresh cheese, available in most supermarkets) this makes a great mild curry. curry - vegetarian - healthy - gluten-free - 30 minutes For two people: Fresh ingredients: 500 g celeriac a pack of chestnut mushrooms (ordinary mushrooms are fine too) about 200 g spinach 1 pack of paneer (about 200 g) 1 cm fresh ginger From the store cupboard: 1 cup basmati rice spices: turmeric, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, cardamom pods, cayenne pepper to taste (I use about a teaspoon of each of the spices and just a pinch of the cayenne pepper) seeds: sesame, sunflower, some pumpkin (I use about 1 tablespoon of each) 1 tablespoon of soy sauce oil for cooking (I use olive oil) optional: garlic oil Fresh ingredients: 500 g celeriac a pack of chestnut mushrooms (ordinary mushrooms are fine too) about 200 g spinach 1 pack of paneer (about 200 g) 1 cm fresh ginger 500 g celeriac a pack of chestnut mushrooms (ordinary mushrooms are fine too) about 200 g spinach 1 pack of paneer (about 200 g) 1 cm fresh ginger 500 g celeriac a pack of chestnut mushrooms (ordinary mushrooms are fine too) about 200 g spinach 1 pack of paneer (about 200 g) 1 cm fresh ginger From the store cupboard: 1 cup basmati rice spices: turmeric, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, cardamom pods, cayenne pepper to taste (I use about a teaspoon of each of the spices and just a pinch of the cayenne pepper) seeds: sesame, sunflower, some pumpkin (I use about 1 tablespoon of each) 1 tablespoon of soy sauce oil for cooking (I use olive oil) optional: garlic oil 1 cup basmati rice spices: turmeric, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, cardamom pods, cayenne pepper to taste (I use about a teaspoon of each of the spices and just a pinch of the cayenne pepper) seeds: sesame, sunflower, some pumpkin (I use about 1 tablespoon of each) 1 tablespoon of soy sauce oil for cooking (I use olive oil) optional: garlic oil 1 cup basmati rice spices: turmeric, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, cardamom pods, cayenne pepper to taste (I use about a teaspoon of each of the spices and just a pinch of the cayenne pepper) seeds: sesame, sunflower, some pumpkin (I use about 1 tablespoon of each) 1 tablespoon of soy sauce oil for cooking (I use olive oil) optional: garlic oil Cook the rice (see basics for how to cook rice). While the rice is cooking: Wash and dice the celeriac. Cook it in the microwave at full power (900W) for 4 minutes, then stir, then cook for another 3 minutes. Wash and slice the mushrooms. If you’re using whole seeds like I do, grind the coriander seeds, cumin seeds and cardamom pods. Chop the ginger very fine. Cut the paneer into cubes of about 1 cm on the side. Heat the oil in a large deep pan. I recommend a non-stick pan with a lid. When the oil is hot, add the ginger, seeds and spices and fry over medium heat for a minute. Add the mushrooms and fry over medium to high heat for a few minutes, until the mushrooms start to release their moisture. Add the paneer and stir until it is evenly covered with the seeds and spices. Fry for a few minutes more over medium heat, then turn up the heat for 30 seconds or so. Clear some space in the middle of the pan and put in the soy sauce. Stir vigorously, then lower the heat. Cook the spinach in the microwave at full power (900W) for 1 minute.

Usually the aubergines are scooped out and then stuffed, but as that takes longer, in this recipe I simply chop them. The original recipe also uses a lot of onion, which I don’t like. The characteristic spice in this dish is allspice, also known as Jamaica pepper. I serve this with maftoul (Palestinian or giant couscous) and feta and garnish with some lime wedges. Turkish-style - vegetarian - healthy - 20 minutes For two people: Fresh ingredients and groceries 1 large aubergine 2 medium tomatoes 1/2 pack feta (Greek goat cheese) 1 lime 1 cup of maftoul (Palestinian or giant couscous) From the store cupboard a handful of pine kernels 1 tablespoon ground allspice some salt or soy sauce optionally some sugar some garlic oil some olive oil (1 tablespoon) for frying Fresh ingredients and groceries 1 large aubergine 2 medium tomatoes 1/2 pack feta (Greek goat cheese) 1 lime 1 cup of maftoul (Palestinian or giant couscous) 1 large aubergine 2 medium tomatoes 1/2 pack feta (Greek goat cheese) 1 lime 1 cup of maftoul (Palestinian or giant couscous) 1 large aubergine 2 medium tomatoes 1/2 pack feta (Greek goat cheese) 1 lime 1 cup of maftoul (Palestinian or giant couscous) From the store cupboard a handful of pine kernels 1 tablespoon ground allspice some salt or soy sauce optionally some sugar some garlic oil some olive oil (1 tablespoon) for frying a handful of pine kernels 1 tablespoon ground allspice some salt or soy sauce optionally some sugar some garlic oil some olive oil (1 tablespoon) for frying a handful of pine kernels 1 tablespoon ground allspice some salt or soy sauce optionally some sugar some garlic oil some olive oil (1 tablespoon) for frying Wash the aubergine and cut into slices of about half a cm thick.

Risotto is a popular Italian-style one-pan dish, delicious and easy to make. It works best with a proper risotto rice like Arborio. I like to serve it with an apple and cherry tomato side salad for contrast. This recipe takes about 30 minutes to prepare. Italian-style - vegetarian - healthy - 30 minutes For two people: Fresh ingredients and groceries pack of oyster mushrooms (150 g) 1 teaspoon ginger, finely chopped half a cup of grated hard cheese (Grana Padano or Parmezan) From the store cupboard 1 cup of risotto rice 2 tablespoons pine kernels 4 dried tomatoes 1 teaspoon turmeric 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1/2 teaspoon salt olive oil for frying (1 tablespoon) 1 teaspoon garlic oil (optional) Fresh ingredients and groceries pack of oyster mushrooms (150 g) 1 teaspoon ginger, finely chopped half a cup of grated hard cheese (Grana Padano or Parmezan) pack of oyster mushrooms (150 g) 1 teaspoon ginger, finely chopped half a cup of grated hard cheese (Grana Padano or Parmezan) pack of oyster mushrooms (150 g) 1 teaspoon ginger, finely chopped half a cup of grated hard cheese (Grana Padano or Parmezan) From the store cupboard 1 cup of risotto rice 2 tablespoons pine kernels 4 dried tomatoes 1 teaspoon turmeric 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1/2 teaspoon salt olive oil for frying (1 tablespoon) 1 teaspoon garlic oil (optional) 1 cup of risotto rice 2 tablespoons pine kernels 4 dried tomatoes 1 teaspoon turmeric 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1/2 teaspoon salt olive oil for frying (1 tablespoon) 1 teaspoon garlic oil (optional) 1 cup of risotto rice 2 tablespoons pine kernels 4 dried tomatoes 1 teaspoon turmeric 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1/2 teaspoon salt olive oil for frying (1 tablespoon) 1 teaspoon garlic oil (optional) Boil half a litre of water. Use some of it (1 cup) to soak the dried tomatoes. While the tomatoes are soaking: Heat the oil and fry the pine kernels, spices and the oyster mushrooms. Add the rice, shake or stir until it’s covered with the spices and the oil. Add some hot water (just enough to cover the rice) and simmer, covered, until the rice has absorbed the water. Add the tomatoes and their soaking liquid, and some more boiled water, stir and simmer, covered, until the rice has absorbed all the liquid. Add the salt and more water, stir and simmer, covered, until the rice has absorbed the water. You may have to add water a few more times, depending on how much you added at a time. It’s ready when the rice is quite creamy (in Italian it’s called all’onda, “wavy”). Boil half a litre of water. Use some of it (1 cup) to soak the dried tomatoes.

Cranberries are very sour so I combine them with apples to sweeten them. The mushrooms make the dish hearty and the chickpeas add crunchiness. vegan - healthy - 20 minutes For two people: Fresh ingredients and groceries two small apples (I used 1 1/2 large ones) 1 mug of frozen cranberries pack of chestnut mushrooms (ordinary mushrooms are fine too) 1 tin chickpeas 1 teaspoon chopped ginger From the store cupboard 1 teaspoon ground cumin 2 tablespoon sunflower seeds 2 tablespoon sesame seeds 1 cup basmati rice 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoon soy sauce Fresh ingredients and groceries two small apples (I used 1 1/2 large ones) 1 mug of frozen cranberries pack of chestnut mushrooms (ordinary mushrooms are fine too) 1 tin chickpeas 1 teaspoon chopped ginger two small apples (I used 1 1/2 large ones) 1 mug of frozen cranberries pack of chestnut mushrooms (ordinary mushrooms are fine too) 1 tin chickpeas 1 teaspoon chopped ginger two small apples (I used 1 1/2 large ones) 1 mug of frozen cranberries pack of chestnut mushrooms (ordinary mushrooms are fine too) 1 tin chickpeas 1 teaspoon chopped ginger From the store cupboard 1 teaspoon ground cumin 2 tablespoon sunflower seeds 2 tablespoon sesame seeds 1 cup basmati rice 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoon soy sauce 1 teaspoon ground cumin 2 tablespoon sunflower seeds 2 tablespoon sesame seeds 1 cup basmati rice 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoon soy sauce 1 teaspoon ground cumin 2 tablespoon sunflower seeds 2 tablespoon sesame seeds 1 cup basmati rice 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoon soy sauce Cook the rice (see basics for how to cook rice).

Cut the paneer into cubes of about 1 cm on the side. Heat the oil in a large deep pan. I recommend a non-stick pan with a lid. When the oil is hot, add the ginger, seeds and spices and fry over medium heat for a few minutes. Add the paneer and stir until it is evenly covered with the seeds and spices. Fry for a few minutes more over medium heat, then turn up the heat for 30 seconds or so. Clear some space in the middle of the pan and put in the soy sauce. Stir vigorously. Add the tomatoes and stir well. Lower the heat and leave to simmer for a few minutes until the tomatoes have softened. You can speed this up by first putting the chopped tomatoes in the microwave for 2 minutes. Cook the spinach in the microwave at full power (900W) for 1 minute. Meanwhile, add the potatoes to the pan, stir until the potatoes are no longer looking white. Cut up the spinach. Add the spinach to the pan, stir and let simmer for a few more minutes.

I wrote a short blog post about what I mean by a Murakami meal. I had aubergines so I decided to prepare them with ponzu (a Japanese dressing). I also made soy beans with shiitake mushrooms and rounded it off with brown rice cooked with konbu seaweed.

There are some original Japanese recipes at Just Hungry and Just One Cookbook. My version is a little bit different: I prefer the potatoes unpeeled, I add some ginger and I use courgette instead of cucumber because I find that British cucumbers are too different from Japanese kyuuri. I serve this potato salad sometimes with rice, or with a side salad as in the picture.

Build a core set of recipes To make a quick meal it is important that you don’t have to think about it. By having a set of ten to twenty favourite recipes, you can quickly make what you like and have a wide variety. Use fresh vegetables for taste I think it is really essential to use fresh vegetables in a meal. Vegetables make the meal balanced; fresh vegetables simply taste so much better than the ones in tins or jars. Don’t overcook This may sound totally obvious, but cook the food for the shortest possible time. Many vegetables don’t need to be cooked at all. All you want is that they are hot and maybe slightly softened. They will taste at their best too. Overcooking your food takes longer and destroys the taste. Add umami Umami is a loanword from the Japanese which can be translated as “pleasant savory taste”, and it is one of the five basic tastes. Even after adding spices, nuts, etc., you may find the food is still not “tasty” enough. That means you need to add some umami. Ingredients that contain a lot of umami are dried tomatoes, dried mushrooms, hard cheese, miso, soy sauce, seaweed, garlic, and also beans (in particular fresh soy beans). Think about texture We appreciate food through more than the taste and smell. The way food feels when you eat it — smooth, crunchy, etc. — is equally important. Vegetables are great for texture, this is another reason not to overcook them. For extra crunch you can add seeds or nuts, for more “bite” dried mushrooms are great, for example. Make a one-pot meal Part of the difficulty with cooking is having to multitask with several pots on the hob. Making a one-pot main meal is much simpler and quicker, because you have only one thing to attend to. Use the microwave The microwave oven is much underrated for cooking. It has the advantages of preparing food quickly, preserving more of the nutrients, and it is hassle-free: you don’t have to watch it and there is less cleaning-up afterwards too.

For a publisher to take interest, I need to have many, many followers on Facebook and Twitter. Please help me to achieve this goal by liking my Facebook page or following me on Twitter: My recipes are quick (really) and easy, don’t require any gadgets and use few ingredients — all of which you can find in the supermarket. All recipes are my own creation, unless credited. I’ll post a new quick & tasty recipe every week.

Japanese Zen Buddhism has a long tradition of what is called “temple cuisine”, a refined and essentially vegan way of cooking. When I was living in Japan, near Kyoto, there was a Zen temple close by, the beautiful Manpukuji. In the shop of the Manpukuji temple I bought this cookbook (in Japanese only) about “fucha ryori” (Zen temple cuisine): The book is full of delicious-looking pictures of the recipes, like this one: What is very different from a regular cookbook is the way the recipes are described: typically, there is a list of ingredients but no amounts, and the method of cooking is described but usually no cooking times are given. Clearly, these details are not the essence of Zen cooking. On the other hand, for every recipe the book mentions if it is for spring, summer, autumn or winter. This connection with the seasons is of great importance in Japan. Also, the the recipes give detailed instructions related to the way the prepared food looks. The aesthetic aspect is as important as the taste. So maybe we can express the Zen way of cooking like this: 普茶料理とはただ材料を選び食を作って盛るばかりなる本を知るべし “To cook the Zen way, just take the right ingredients, prepare the food, then serve it properly.” Fuss-free food Updated April 06, 2016 About Blog Terms About Blog Terms © 2016 Jekyll theme Skinny Bones","tags":"","url":"articles/zen-cooking/index.html"}, ]};
