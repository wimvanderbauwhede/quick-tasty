So I focus on tasty, healthy meals that are simple and easy to make in a short time. I mostly use ingredients that are easy to find in any supermarket, and most of my recipes take less than 30 minutes to put on the table. My goal with Wim’s Quick and Tasty Food is to write a cookbook and donate the proceeds to the UN World Food Programme. For a publisher to take interest, I need to have many, many followers on Facebook and Twitter. Please help me to achieve this goal by liking my Facebook page or following me on Twitter: I’ve lived in Japan for a short time and I’ve been influenced by the Japanese kitchen, with its emphasis on simplicity, and so I will include some Japanese recipes as well.

All of these are actually very easy. Cooking rice Cooking rice is very easy. The basic rule is: use 2 cups water for 1 cup rice (for Basmati it is only about 1.2 cups for 1 cup rice, for Japanese rice it is 1.1 cup water for 1 cup rice). The cup I use is 200 ml. I wash the rice a few times to get rid of dust and also of the rice flour from polishing. For Japanese rice, you should not just rinse it but also actually “wash” the rice by gently rubbing the grains together between your fingers. A detailed explanation can be found at Makiko Itoh’s site Just Hungry. To cook the 1 cup of rice in the microwave: Put the rice with the water in a microwave-compatible pot with a lid Cook at full power (900W) for one and a half minutes Cook at reduced power (40%, 360W) for 15 minutes. For basmati or Japanese rice this is enough; wholegrain rice takes more time, about 25 minutes. Check if all the water is gone, if not give it another 5 minutes, then check again. To cook the 1 cup of rice on the hob: Put the rice with the water in pot with a lid Bring to the boil Cook over low heat for about 15-20 minutes. For basmati or Japanese rice this is enough; wholegrain rice takes about 25-30 minutes.

Cooking potatoes If you use the microwave, cooking potatoes is again very easy: Wash the potatoes and cut out any eyes or damaged parts, but don’t peel them. You can either cook large potatoes whole or chop them up into small chunks. If you like them whole, pierce them several times with a fork. Put in the microwave at full power for about 10 minutes (for 500g potatoes). Check if they are ready by pricking with a fork or just tasting. If they are not ready, give it another 5 minutes, then check again. Wash the potatoes and cut out any eyes or damaged parts, but don’t peel them.

If they are not ready, give it another 5 minutes, then check again. You can of course cook them on the hob as well but the microwave is a better option, it is quicker and the cooked potatoes taste better too. Cooking pasta Pasta is one of the few foods that I do not cook in the microwave, because you need a large pot with plenty of water. My approach is a bit different from what most other people do, but again very easy: Bring 2 l of water to the boil with a bit of salt (say 1/2 tsp) When the water is boiling heavily, add the pasta (100 g per person) and stir until all the pasta is submerged. Cook for 3 minutes in heavily boiling water, without a lid. Take the pot off the hob, put the lid on and let it stand for the remainder of the time indicated on the package. For example if the cooking time on the package says 12 minutes (quite typical), then leave it for 9 minutes. Strain, sprinkle with some olive oil and serve.

There is no special reason for this other than that I prefer ginger. So let’s make the case for ginger. Many people don’t like onion, raw or cooked. Also peeling and chopping onion is not pleasant, and the smell of onion is hard to wash off your hands. And yet most recipes contain onion. By contrast, few recipes contain fresh ginger. I argue that you don’t need onion to make tasty meals, and that you should consider using fresh ginger instead, and I present the Quick and Tasty recipes as evidence. The main flavours cooked onion adds to a meal are sweetness and umami. But onion is actually not a particularly good source of umami. According to the web site of the Umami Information Center, onion contains about 20-50 mg glutamate/100 g. Ginger contains about 20 mg as well. For reference, tomatoes — a great source of umami — contain almost 250 mg glutamate/100 g. There are many other ingredients that provide umami. Ginger has a unique fresh and very spicy taste, especially in raw form, but it does not burn the mouth like peppers. Raw ginger is great to spice up a salad. Frying reduces the spiciness and enhances the sweetness. The change in taste is the result of applying heat (which transforms gingerol into zingerone) so cooking in the microwave works fine as well, you don’t need to actually fry it. Ginger has many proven health benefits, but the great taste is reason enough to start using it. Here are a few examples of Quick and Tasty recipes with ginger: With raw ginger: Salad: Asparagus and paneer on a bed of rocket and courgettes Soba noodles with soy beans Salad: Asparagus and paneer on a bed of rocket and courgettes Soba noodles with soy beans With cooked ginger: Simple winter hotpot with root vegetables and adzuki beans Potato and vegetable bake with cream cheese Simple winter hotpot with root vegetables and adzuki beans Potato and vegetable bake with cream cheese With fried ginger: Mild root vegetable curry with paneer and rice Iridofu with carrots and shiitake Mild root vegetable curry with paneer and rice Iridofu with carrots and shiitake Most fresh ginger in the UK is imported from China (somewhat surprising as India is the main producer), so you might be concerned about your ginger carbon footprint. I calculated that the contribution of the ginger to my carbon footprint is at most 0.01%. The CO2 footprint of shipping is 10 g per km per 1,000 kg of freight. The distance from China is 19,000 km. My ginger consumption is about 100 g per 2 weeks (7-10 g per meal), so about 2.5 kg per year. The CO2 footprint of shipping is 10 g per km per 1,000 kg of freight. The distance from China is 19,000 km. My ginger consumption is about 100 g per 2 weeks (7-10 g per meal), so about 2.5 kg per year. So we have or about half a kilogram CO2 per year. Using the WWF carbon footprint calculator, I estimate my carbon footprint to be 7-12 tons of CO2 per year. This means that my ginger consumption accounts for no more than 0.5/7,000 or 0.0071% of my yearly carbon footprint.

The study A few days ago a new study was published saying that “Eating more fruits and vegetables may prevent millions of premature deaths”. The media message was that we should eat “10 portions of fruit/veg per day”. But what did the paper really say, and how much is this “10-a-day” anyway? What the study did was looking at a large number (92) of other studies on this topic. The study does not actually mention “10 portions”, instead they looked at fruit and veg intake up to 800g/day. This is twice the official UK recommendation of 400g/day, hence the “10-a-day”. For comparison, the US recommendation is “1.5–2.0 cups of fruit and 2–3 cups of vegetables daily”, and as a cup is 240ml, this is considerably more than 400g/day. I have read the paper and I think this is a reliable study with a sound methodology. The main uncertainty I think comes from the fact that in the individual studies (what they call “cohort studies”), the amounts of fruit and vegetables consumed are self-reported by the participants using food-frequency questionnaires. This has been shown to lead to overestimating the consumption due to “social approval bias” (eating more fruit is good). It is not clear if the cohort studies corrected for this factor; in any case this would not change the observed trends. What about the health benefits? The paper shows that the relative risk of death from coronary heart disease, stroke and cancer is lower for people who eat more fruit and vegetables. As you can see from the figure below (Fig. 6 in the paper), eating 400g/day (“5-a-day”) already leads to a significantly lower risk. To put this into perspective, the relative risk of death from coronary heart disease for men of age 40-44 due to smoking is 6.3. That means that smoking increases your risk by more than 6 times compared to not smoking. By comparison, eating 800g/day instead of 400g/day reduces your relative risk from 0.75 to 0.70 compared to eating no fruits or vegetables at all. The key message of paper is that, assuming there is a causal link, then the percentage of deaths per year due to coronary heart disease, stroke and cancer that could have been avoided by eating 800g fruit/veg a day was 9%, whereas for 500g fruit/veg a day it was 6% (in the UK). So increasing intake from 500g/day to 800g/day would result in 3% fewer deaths, or 14,000 deaths prevented (total number of deaths from these causes was 315,000/year in the UK). The unknown factor is of course if the reduced risk is only because of the diet or if people who eat more fruit and vegetables have lower risks due to other causes as well. Is 800g/day a lot or not? A typical meal contains about 300g vegetables per person. A piece of fruit (say an orange, apple or a banana) typically weighs 100-200g, so two pieces of fruit a day is on average 300g. So eating 600g fruit and vegetables per day is actually very easy to achieve. If your other meals also contain some fruit or vegetables then even 800g/day is really not hard. So don’t be daunted by the “10-a-day’!

So I had to go and buy everything — great fun when you’re jet-lagged. I went to a supermarket and bought amongst other things a very sharp knife (partly showing on the banner of the recipes page), a great versatile microwave pot (featuring on the banner of my post about the microwave), and the cheap-but-beautiful black-and-red bowls. I also bought three kitchen tools that I particularly like: ##A flexible, antibacterial cutting mat This mat contains a phytoncide, an antibacterial organic compound derived from plants. To kill all the germs you simply put it in the microwave for a minute. And it can go in the dishwasher as well. You can buy it on line, just search for “phytoncide cutting board”. ##A pair of bamboo cooking chopsticks Long chopsticks are great for cooking pasta or noodles. No risk of burning your fingers and handier than a fork too. You can easily find plain ones but I liked the sakura decoration (cherry blossoms), and it actually has ridges for a better grip. ##A rice scoop Japanese rice is different from other rice in the way it sticks together: when properly cooked, each grain is still quite firm but the grains have a sticky outer layer. That’s why every Japanese kitchen has a rice scoop like this, with little nobs that stop the rice from sticking to it. The scoop can be put upright on its handle, very nifty!

I had always been very interested in Japan, so this was a great opportunity. I started planning a research visit, and at that point I thought it would be better to learn some Japanese. So about three months before the trip I started my first Japanese lesson. Fortunately, nobody told me one should not attempt to learn a new language over the age of forty. And anyone who has learned some Japanese will appreciate how ridiculously short a time three months is; luckily I didn’t know any better. In any case, I started learning very basic Japanese and I loved it: the writing system, the grammar, the culture as expressed through the language. Learning your first kanji (Chinese characters used in Japanese) is a great experience, because kanji are mysterious, beautiful and concise – and you think you can see the logic to it. And learning the first phrases makes you feel it won’t be all that hard. It’s wonderful. Because of the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, I had to postpone my trip. But in the summer of 2012, having learned Japanese for a bit more than a year, I went to Kyoto for a two-month research visit. And it was amazing: kanji everywhere! Somewhere along the path, learning Japanese had become a goal in its own right, not just a practical tool for survival in the wild. It was that as well, of course – just try shopping in a Japanese supermarket without knowing any Japanese. So I conversed in broken Japanese, and looked up kanji on my phone (and was surprised how many signs said “dentist”), and tried to improve my hiragana and katakana reading skills. I didn’t actively study, the total immersion was all I wanted. At that time I had learned only basic grammar and sentence structure, very little informal Japanese – my teacher does not hold with that – and about 100 of the 500 most frequent kanji. I quickly discovered that “most frequent” does not really mean “common” or vice versa. The “most frequent kanji” list is based on newspaper articles, so there are many common kanji that are not in that list. Also, “knowing” or “having learned” a kanji is a rather vague term, and being able to tick them off in a spaced repetition app like Anki or Memrise (great tools though they are!) does not mean you know the meaning of a word consisting of “known” kanji, let alone its pronunciation. Kanji typically have several meanings, sometimes wildly different (e.g. 洗　means both “wash” and “inquire into”) and several readings, some based on the original Chinese pronunciation of the character, some on the Japanese pronunciation of the meaning of the character (e.g. 明日 “tomorrow” can be read as “ashita”, “asu” or “myonichi”). So there is a lot to learn. By now I was hooked, by both the language and the country. Two more years of study later I visited Japan again. On that visit I bought the paperback version of Haruki Murakami’s “1Q84”. It comes in 6 volumes, each about 400 pages. I started reading it on my return (October 2014). It is a slow process because really my Japanese is by far not good enough. I continuously encounter kanji that I have not learned yet or already forgotten, so I have to look them up. Luckily I can do this on my phone, by writing them stroke by stroke. It is now April 2016 and I have reached page 295 (of 357) in the first volume. At this rate, it will take me another 15 years to finish the book. This may not seem very encouraging. However, I hope of course that my reading skills will improve. And in fact I have found reading this way to be more enjoyable than reading the book in English translation: reading Japanese requires a deeper concentration and I feel more immersed in the story – and I find the Japanese writing simply beautiful. The books have also inspired me to make a few “Murakami meals”, which I’ll be posting soon. Speaking of food, I also bought a Zen temple cuisine cookbook, available in Japanese only. It gives a unique insight in the Zen way of cooking – and the language and vocabulary are much easier than Murakami’s. I’d like to thank my teacher Rie Ogura for her patience with me, waiting endlessly while I fumble for the right words.

Haruki Murakami is a bestselling Japanese author. Food is a recurrent theme in his novels. I love the way he lets his characters prepare food, like Nakata in “Kafka on the Shore” peering in the fridge and whipping up a great meal in no time for himself and Hoshino, or Aomame in “1Q84” eating cucumber with mayonaise, or the narrator in “Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World” cooking for the librarian. What I call a “Murakami meal” is a meal made quickly with what you find in the fridge. And although Murakami frequently lets his characters prepare and eat Western-style food, I’ll post recipes for Japanese-style food. Also, of course, my recipes will be vegetarian. My “Murakami meal #1” is aubergines with ponzu, soy beans with shiitake and brown rice with konbu.

There are many, many varieties of rice but in this post I just want to introduce the ones I like and use frequently. Basmati rice, a fragrant, aromatic rice from India, is my staple, mainly because it has such a short cooking time (just 15 minutes). It is very fluffy when cooked right. I have used it in several recipes, for example my favourite Basmati rice with tomatoes and halloumi. The brown rice I use is either Basmati or regular long grain rice. The picture shows Kilombero rice from Malawi. Brown rice has a more earthy taste than white rice and takes longer to cook (about 30 minutes). It it a better source of dietary fiber and vitamines than white rice. Broadly speaking brown rice contains 3x more fiber and vitamins than white rice. It also contains about 3x more magnesium, phosphorus and manganese; for other minerals (calcium, iron, zinc) the difference is smaller. A brown rice meal of 200 g cooked rice will get you about 40% RDA of phosphorus and vitamin B6, 10% RDA of magnesium and vitamin B3. Brown rice goes really well with lentils. Red rice has a nice nutty flavour. I use red rice from the Camargue region in France. This is a recent variety, a result of cross-pollination of cultivated white rice with wild red rice in the 1980s. In terms of cooking time and nutritional value it is similar to brown rice. For an unusual recipe with red rice, check out my aubergine boats with soy beans and red rice. To make risotto you need a rice that can absorb a lot of water without getting sticky. To cook risotto rice you should add the water a little bit at at time, and keep stirring until it has been absorbed, rather than adding it all at once. Through constant stirring, the outer part of the rice grain is ground off by the friction and the starch mixes with the cooking liquid and turns into a creamy sauce that binds the grains together. The typical variety that I use is Arborio. My favourite risotto is the one with oyster mushrooms. For Japanese-style dishes you really need proper Japonica rice: the rice grains cling together without being mushy when cooked properly. It doesn’t necessarily have to come from Japan though. I use either Yumenishiki or Clearspring’s sushi rice, both are grown in Italy. Yumenishiki’s koshihikari is an actual Japanese variety; the Clearspring rice is an Italian Japonica variety, Selenio, which is very similar in taste and properties to Japanese rice. When I was in Japan I used kinuhikari, a local variety from Kyoto. A nice Japanese-style recipe is aubergines, sweet potatoes, tofu and wakame with rice.

Fuss-free food Updated August 14, 2016 About Blog Terms About Blog Terms © 2020 Jekyll theme Skinny Bones","tags":"","url":"recipes/risotto-green-peas/index.html"}, {"title":"Reading Murakami in Japanese","text":" Reading Murakami in Japanese As mentioned in previous posts, I started reading Murakami’s 1Q84 in Japanese in October 2014, after I had been learning Japanese for about three years. The paperback (bunko, 文庫) edition consists of 6 volumes, two volumes for each of the three Books that make up 1Q84. Each volume is about 400 pages. In July 2016 I finished the first volume. It is now May 2019 and I have finally finished the four volumes comprising Books 1 and 2. At first, my reading speed was very slow, about half an hour per page, because I constantly had to look up kanji and grammar constructs. In the last three years, my reading speed has fortunately improved quite a bit: it takes me now five minutes to read a page in Japanese. However, to read the equivalent English translation takes only one minute, so I still have some way to go. As my reading improved, I started to use different ways of reading. Reading aloud In Japanese, “reading aloud” is called rōdoku (ろうどく, 朗読), a word I quite like because rō means “melodious, clear, bright, serene, cheerful”. Maybe somewhat surprisingly, it turns out that silent reading is a relatively young development: before the 17th century, reading essentially meant reading aloud. I find reading aloud very useful because it helps me to understand the flow of the sentence and I also find it easier to understand the meaning. There are many other benefits to reading aloud, as explained in this article on Voices.com. A small disadvantage is that I can get stuck on any kanji for which I don’t know the pronunciation – I find it hard to continue without looking it up right away in my dictionary. Still, I like to read aloud also because I simply like the sound of Japanese. Reading without vocalising When reading Japanese silently (mokudoku もくどく, 黙読), I usually subvocalise, i.e. I hear the text in my head. However, I found that not doing this has some interesting advantages. I am of course not the first one to make this observation, see e.g. Significance of Silent Reading, but these are my observations for the particular case of reading Japanese as a non-native. For one, I don’t get stuck on unknown kanji readings, so my flow is not broken so easily. Also, it means that I go straight from word shapes to meanings. For example, I do not need to know that 菜食主義者 is pronounced saishokushugisha (さいしょくしゅぎしゃ) to know that it means “vegetarian” (菜 sai is vegetable, 食 shoku is to eat, 主義 shugi is doctrine and 者 sha is person). Even for new words it is often possible to tell the meaning from the kanji – one of the advantages of a writing system based on logograms. When not vocalising, it is not necessary to read every individual character. In Japanese the grammar is usually conveyed using groups of hiragana characters and I find that just geting the overall shape is enough to see if a sequence of characters is a negation, or a polite suffix etc. And finally it allows me to speed-read: I can simply scan the text for kanji that indicate the “interesting” parts. And I can now add speed reading to my vocabulary as well: sokudoku (そくどく, 速読). Further reading Here are some articles for your perusal (jukudoku, じゅくどく, 熟読). An interesting Japanese article on silent reading and reading aloud: 黙読と朗読・音読の違い. About reading, but otherwise unrelated: Reading the Roman alphabet in Japanese isn’t as easy as ABC.

Build a core set of recipes To make a quick meal it is important that you don’t have to think about it. By having a set of ten to twenty favourite recipes, you can quickly make what you like and have a wide variety. Use fresh vegetables for taste I think it is really essential to use fresh vegetables in a meal. Vegetables make the meal balanced; fresh vegetables simply taste so much better than the ones in tins or jars. Don’t overcook This may sound totally obvious, but cook the food for the shortest possible time. Many vegetables don’t need to be cooked at all. All you want is that they are hot and maybe slightly softened. They will taste at their best too. Overcooking your food takes longer and destroys the taste. Add umami Umami is a loanword from the Japanese which can be translated as “pleasant savory taste”, and it is one of the five basic tastes. Even after adding spices, nuts, etc., you may find the food is still not “tasty” enough. That means you need to add some umami. Ingredients that contain a lot of umami are dried tomatoes, dried mushrooms, hard cheese, miso, soy sauce, seaweed, garlic, and also beans (in particular fresh soy beans). Think about texture We appreciate food through more than the taste and smell. The way food feels when you eat it — smooth, crunchy, etc. — is equally important. Vegetables are great for texture, this is another reason not to overcook them. For extra crunch you can add seeds or nuts, for more “bite” dried mushrooms are great, for example. Make a one-pot meal Part of the difficulty with cooking is having to multitask with several pots on the hob. Making a one-pot main meal is much simpler and quicker, because you have only one thing to attend to. Use the microwave The microwave oven is much underrated for cooking. It has the advantages of preparing food quickly, preserving more of the nutrients, and it is hassle-free: you don’t have to watch it and there is less cleaning-up afterwards too.

You only need flour, water and salt. The whole process takes about five hours, but the total amount of active work is only half an hour. The videos and blog from Bake with Jack helped me a lot. Apart from an oven, you will need the following items: A container of about 500 ml for the sourdough starter. I use a plastic mug with a lid, it does not have to close tightly. A glass jar is fine too. A container of about 500 ml for water. A spoon or fork for mixing. A recipient to mix your dough. It should hold least 2 or 3 l, for example a plastic pot or stainless steel cooking pot. I can strongly recommend the Lekue Bread Maker, a silicone bread mould that can go straight into the oven. Optional: a baking tin to shape your loaf. With my recipe, the dough is quite wet so it does not keep its shape well. I use the Lekue for this. Optional: kitchen scales.

The difference between sourdough bread and ordinary bread is that you use a sourdough starter instead of baking yeast. The great thing about a sourdough starter is that you can very easily make it yourself, from just flour and water. Have a look at my recipe. For this loaf I only use four ingredients: 150 g sourdough starter 450 g water 675 g wholemeal wheat flour 8 g salt 150 g sourdough starter 450 g water 675 g wholemeal wheat flour 8 g salt First add 150 g starter to your mixing container. Then add 450 g water Then add 675 g flour Then add 8 g salt Mix thoroughly Knead for about ten minutes Leave to rise in a cold oven. I put a tray with hot water in the oven and let the dough rise there, so it keeps warm and wet. After 30 minuts, fold the dough 12 times. “Folding” means that you pull on the dough, which is very elastic, and fold the pulled flap over the main ball of dough. The Bake with Jack video shows very clearly how to do this. Leave for an hour Fold 6 times; leave for an hour Fold 6 times; leave for another hour Preheat the oven on 230 °C Fold another 6 times As you can see from the picure, I sprinkled some pumpkin seeds on top. Bake for 20 minutes at 230 °C. I put a small container with very hot water on the baking tray to get some steam. Bake for another 40 minutes at 200 °C. Leave to cool on a rack.

Most recipes use wholemeal rye flour but I use wholemeal wheat flour which is a little less sour. This recipe is for 150 g sourdough starter, which is the amount I use for a single loaf. Take a container of about 500 ml. I use a plastic mug with a lid, it does not have to close tightly. Add 25 g flour and 25 g water at 35 °C, mix (I use the handle of spoon), leave for 24 hours at room temperature (20-25 °C; the warmer, the quicker). Repeat for three consecutive days.

When you make your first loaf with a fresh starter, leave about 20 g starter in the container to make your next batch. I just keep this in the fridge. Then, the day before I bake the next loaf, in the morning, add 75 g water at 35 °C and 75 g flour to the container, stir well, and leave it at room temperature for a day. Put it in the fridge before you go to bed. The next day, take the started out of the fridge 3-4 hours before you start to bake. Because you have now 170 g starter in the container, you can use 150 g for the loaf and then feed the starter again, for as long as you like.

At the Disaster Prevention Research Institute of Kyoto University, researchers are modelling the flow of the wind over the city. The wind that blows over the tiny machiyas of Gion and around Kyoto station with its tall hotels and the Tower. In spring, it scatters a storm of sakura petals all over the city. In the rainy season, it blows down from Arashiyama along the waters of the Katsuragawa, and carries streams of clouds over the hills. When the temple ponds are full of lotus flowers, it stirs the lanterns and chases the incense smoke, and cools the faces of the teams that pull the Yamaboko along Shijou Doori. At the end of summer, when the higanbana is blooming, that same wind follows the railway line to Uji and blows in through the open window of the researchers’ offices, rifling the stacks of diagrams that reveal its very flow. But sometimes that flow gathers to a tremendous strength, and then a typhoon will lacerate the city. The models of the wind predicts this, to make sure the people of Kyoto are prepared. Then Kyoto hunkers down, and waits. When the storm has passed, the sky is a transparent clear and blue. The wind of Kyoto is once again cool and mild, blowing gently over the city.

A spoon or fork for mixing. Optional: a baking tin to shape your loaf. I use the Lekue for this. Optional: kitchen scales. Mine is a very plain model from Salter.

I like to add some seeds, nuts and/or dried fruit. 25 g raisins or sultanas 25 g chopped walnuts a handful of sunflower seeds to put on top 25 g raisins or sultanas 25 g chopped walnuts a handful of sunflower seeds to put on top The main difference between this recipe and the more common ones is the amount of water, which is considerably higher (most recipes say 200 ml for 400 g). As a result, the dough is not as easy to knead and much more sticky. This is why we use the “folding” technique as explained in the videos from Bake with Jack. Another great tip from that video is to sprinkle your hands with water instead of flour to stop the dough from sticking to them. With the extra water the dough rises a lot better, so the result is a more open texture. Add all ingredients to your mixing container Mix thoroughly Knead for about ten to fifteen minutes Leave to rise in a cold oven. I put a tray with hot water in the oven and let the dough rise there, so it keeps warm and wet. After half an hour, fold the dough 12 times. “Folding” means that you pull on the dough, which is very elastic, and fold the pulled flap over the main ball of dough. The Bake with Jack video shows very clearly how to do this. Leave for half an hour Fold 6 times; leave for half an hour Fold 6 times; leave for another half an hour Preheat the oven on 230 °C Fold another 6 times As you can see from the picure, I sprinkled some sunflower seeds on top.

After reading some reviews I wrote a blog post on why some of the characters frequently repeat one another, something critics didn’t like. Another thing several critics didn’t like is the Little People saying “Ho ho”. So let’s have a look at this “Ho ho”. But first, in case you didn’t read the book, a quick setting of the scene may help. Air Chrysalys In 1Q84, there is a “book in the book” called “Air Chrysalys” (kuukisanagi, 空気さなぎ). This book is a kind of fairytale told from the perspective of a ten-year-old girl who lives in a rural commune. As punishment for letting an old mountain goat die, she gets locked up in a shed with the dead goat for a period of ten days*. One night, the “Little People”** appear from the mouth of the dead goat. This scene starts with one of my favourite descriptions in the Japanese text: あたりが暗くなると、死んだ山羊の目が星明かりを受けてきらりと光った。 atari ga kuraku naru to, shinda yagi no me ga hoshiakari wo ukete kirari to hikatta. In the English translation by Jay Rubin, this reads: When darkness falls, the dead goat’s eye sparkles in the starlight. The Japanese sentence sparkles a bit more because kirari to means “with a momentary flash of light” and hikatta means shine or glitter. Murakami puts the reader nicely on the wrong foot, because when six small figures emerge from the goat’s mouth, the little girl thinks “This is like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but there is one missing”. The “Little People” read her thoughts and when she counts again there are seven of them. Together with the girl they start to make an “air chrysalys” by pulling white threads out of thin air and weaving a kind of cocoon from them. While doing so, they talk to the girl. “Ho ho,” says the keeper of the beat The Little People don’t have names or personalities and indeed it is impossible to keep them apart or even describe them in detail, but they have distinct voices. Usually, each of them speaks a short sentence in turn. There is a recurrent pattern where one of them, in translation called the “keeper of the beat”, says “Ho ho”, and the others chorus “Ho ho”: ｢ほうほう｣はやし役のリトル・ピープルがはやした ｢ほうほう｣残りの六人が声を合わせた “houhou” hayashiyaku no RITORU PIIPURU ga hayashita “houhou” nokori no rokunin ga koe wo awaseta In the Japanese text, the “keeper of the beat” is called hayashiyaku (はやし役) and calls out houhou (ほうほう). This matters because if this “Ho ho” was merely an interjection or exclamation, it would likely be written hoohoo (ほぉほぉ or ほおほお). So we can assume that houhou has a meaning. Japanese has many homonyms and this is no exception. There are several possible ways to write houhou, in hiragana or kanji (Chinese characters), each with a different meaning. According to Kotobank, houhou (ほうほう) means ① 物を投げたりたたいたりする音、またはそのさまを表わす語。ぽんぽん。 “The sound of repeatedly throwing or striking something, or a word to representing it” One of the kanji writings of houhou (ほうほう) is 彭々), which makes the meaning more clear because the character 彭 means “the sound of a drum”. Because Murakami wrote the word in hiragana, we can’t be entirely sure, but the meanings of the other kanji writings (這々 perplexity, 方法 method) do not make much sense in the given context. The link with Noh theatre One of the Little People, who Murakami calls the hayashiyaku, calls out “Ho ho”, and the other six echo this in chorus. The translator of the book, the great Jay Rubin, translates hayashiyaku as “keeper of the beat” to reflect the meaning of houhou as drum beat, and also because Murakami uses the verb hayasu which literally means “to keep time”. So “says the keeper of the beat” is a very nice way to translate this. But the literal meaning in Japanese is “member of a hayashi”, and hayashi (囃子) is the four-piece orchestra in the traditional Noh theatre, consisting of three drummers and a flutist. The task of the drummers is to keep the rhythm (hayasu), but they also use their voices to create drum calls. Another component of Noh is the chorus, usually six to eight people. And finally there are the actors, who unlike in traditional Western theatre do not ony speak their own lines, but can also ‘describe events from the perspective of another character or even a disinterested narrator’. With this interpretation, Murakami allocates to his seven Little People the roles of actors, chorus and orchestra in a Noh performance, all at the same time, with an audience of one, the little girl. I think this is what lies behind the Little People saying “Ho ho”.   * In Japan, traditionally a month is split in three ten-day periods called jun(旬). ** Murakami calls them リトル・ピープル (RITORU PIIPURU) which is katakana rendition of the English “Little People”.

Going vegan is great but there are some common pitfals if you come from a omnivorous diet. Just cutting out all non-plant-based food might leave you feeling dissatisfied, and craving some of your old food. If your vegan meals are not nutritiously balanced, this will also affect your health. Both are common reasons why people give up on a vegan diet. The good news is that making balanced and tasty vegan meals is quite easy. You could of course just make one of my recipes, but if you want to make your own, here are a few simple guidelines, supported by expert nutritional advice. But let’s first have a look at the fundamentals of a healthy diet. Fundamentals of a healthy diet A healthy diet should provide your body with the following: Proteins, for growth and maintenance. Our bodies do not use the proteins we eat directly, but break them down into amino acids. There are nine essential amino acids which we must obtain from our diet to prevent protein-energy malnutrition. Making sure our meals contain sufficient amounts of these is easy, there are several foods such as beans and pulses that are “complete proteins” which provide all essential amino acids. Vitamins and minerals , nutrients our bodies need in small amounts to work properly and stay healthy. From this angle, there is not much difference between a vegan diet and other diets, with the exception of vitamin B12. As there are no plant-based sources, this needs to be taken as a supplement. Essential fatty acids , needed for many physiological processes, including maintenance of cell membrane structure and skin integrity. There are only two of them, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Again, they are easy to add to your diet: several types of nuts, seeds and vegetable oils are good sources. Carbohydrates, for energy and to aid digestion. Although recently “carbs” got a bad reputation, they are really essential for a healthy diet. There are three main types of carbohydrates: sugar, starch, and fibre. For a healthy diet we need all of them, in the right amounts. The main sources are typical starchy foods like rice, pasta and potatoes. The less refined the food, the better as a source of fibre.

It’s not really neccessary to have all components for every meal though, as long as your diet on the whole provides them. Simple guidelines That may seem like a lot to take in. So how do you make sure you get all these on a daily basis? I use as a very simple rule that my meals should have: A source of protein. Based on the “Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score”, the best sources are tofu, soy beans, chick peas and black beans, but other types of beans or pulses are good too. I use about 100 g per person per meal. A source of starchy carbohydrates, such as rice, pasta and other grain-based foods, or potatoes and similar root vegetables. For rice or pasta I use about 100 g per person per meal, for potatoes about 250g (uncooked weight). A source of fresh vegetables, whatever you like, but as much variety as possible. These provide you with vitamins and some of the minerals, as well as some carbohydrates and protein. I use about 200 g per person per meal (uncooked weight). Some nuts or seeds, like pumkin seeds, sunflower seeds or walnuts. These are great sources of omega fatty acids and minerals. Just a handful is enough. A source of protein.

Like all his novels, this novel is many things. For this article I want to view it as a reflection on morality. Almost all of the characters have to make complex moral choices based on incomplete or incorrect information. One such character is Tamaru, a bodyguard and security expert in the service of a rich old widow who has embarked on a personal crusade against domestic violence. He is at the same time a very cultured person and a consummate professional. But this article is really about a something that puzzled me. In one of the final chapters (Chapter 25 of Book 3), just before he has to make a very hard moral choice, Tamaru recounts an interesting story about the famous Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jung. He explains how Jung lived in a large house in Zürich, but wanted a place to think and work in solitude. So he built a place which he called the “Tower”, in Bollingen near the shore of the Zürich lake. He built it with his own hands from stones from a local quarry, and had to join the guild become a licensed stone mason to be allowed to do so. It was an austere place, without gas, electricity or running water. On the lintel above the entrance, Jung engraved a phrase which in Japanese reads: 冷たくても、冷たくなくても、神はここにいる Tsumetakutemo, tsumetakunakutemo, kami wa koko ni iru In the English translation by Philip Gabriel, this runs “Cold or Not, God Is Present”. This phrase is also the title of the chapter, and I think that because of this story about Jung, this chapter might very well be the key chapter of the entire novel. I was intrigued by the phrase and started to read up on Jung, to try and find out more about this story. It turns out that the story as told by Tamaru is not entirely accurate: Jung did indeed build the tower with his own hands. He started building it in 1923, when he was 48, and worked on it and reshaped it for most of the rest of his life [1]. And he did put an inscription above the entrance of the original tower. It is the same inscription that was first engraved over the entrance of his house in Küsnacht [2]. However, the words as mentioned by Tamaru are different from the inscription. The original inscription is in Latin and reads “Vocatus atque non vocatus deus aderit”, which translates as “Bidden or unbidden, the god will be present”. The origin of this phrase is interesting: the Latin phrase is from the Adagia, a collection of sayings from ancient sources collected by Erasmus. The actual source is the “History of the Peloponnesian War”, written around 400 BC by the Athenian historian and general Thucydides. In it, he recounts how the Spartans asked the Oracle of Apollo in Delphi if it would go well with them if they went to war with Athens. The oracle answered that if they put all their strength into the war, victory would be theirs, and that “the god himself would be there, whether invoked or uninvoked” [3]. Jung himself knew this background, and he commented “It says: yes, the god will be on the spot, but in what form and to what purpose? I have put the inscription there to remind my patients and myself: Timor dei initium sapientiae.” (Fear of God is the start of wisdom) [4]. Jung’s view on religion was that people need a God because a person needs to recognise a higher authority than the ego. Without a God, a person will make a God out of something else. So there will be a God in people’s lives, whether they want it or not, for good or for worse. Hence the choice of the phrase. As the original phrase is different from Tamaru’s quote, either Tamaru has it wrong, or in the parallel universe of 1Q84, the inscription is different. That is of course very well possible: as the novel makes clear, 1Q84 is superficially the same as 1984 but differs from it in many subtle ways; Tamaru being a person who is very precise in his mental habits, it is not so likely that he would not have checked the translation of a phrase which he considers so important. In fact, he comments that “There’s some deep allusion here, something difficult to interpret.”. So I am assuming that in the 1Q84 universe, the inscription is different. I am of course not the first one to point this out [5], and several people have surmised that this is a pun on cold/called, [6,7] because a possible English translation of the Latin phrase is “Called or uncalled, God is present”. As explained above, this is only one possible translation – “vocatus” could be translated as “bidden” or “summoned” as well, and “the god” is more accurate than “God” – and somehow I find this theory not satisfactory. At first sight, the cold/called theory may seem to be corroborated because Tamaru mentions that the Catholic orphanage where he grew up was always cold, even in summer. However, in Japanese, Tamaru there uses the word “samui” (寒い) which means that it felt cold to him, whereas in the phrase he uses the word “tsumetai” (冷たい), which means that something is cold. Because of his experience in that cruel place, he also says that as far as he is concerned, if God existed, He could not be said to be kind at all. The Japanese adjective shinsetsu (親切,しんせつ) which he uses means “kind,” but is used to describe the character of someone based on their actions. I am therefore inclined to interpret the “tsumetai” as “emotionally cold, unfeeling, indifferent”. In other words, God is here, but we don’t know if he is indifferent or not. That is to my mind also closer to Jung’s own interpretation of the Latin phrase, and yet different of course, as might be expected in 1Q84. I don’t think it is a coincidence that Murakami introduces Jung at the end of this novel. Arguably, the actions of many of the characters match Jung’s views on good and evil. For example Ushikawa, who is the protagonist of the chapter, and quite a creep, is at some point shown his dark side (what Jung calls the Shadow) but decides to embrace it instead of reject it. And it is not a stretch to view the Little People as a kind of collective god: they have no individuality but collectively they have supernatural powers. They are also clearly not bound by human morals, and are (not unlike the Greek gods) quite indifferent to the fate of humans. And they speak through a human, i.e. a prophet, or an oracle. Considering that Jung developed the theory of the collective unconscious, and the notion of archetypes, having a collective god seems fitting. The banner picture of this article is the cover of the 2nd volume of Book 3 in the Japanese paperback. In Japanese, “1Q84” and “1984” are both pronounced as “ichi-kew-hachi-yon”, that’s why this is written underneath the title. The cover illustration for each volume is a detail of “The Garden of Earthly Delights” by Jheronimus Bosch.

This is a twin post, the other version is on Eidon’s blog. Here is the finished track. We hope you like it! Your browser does not support the audio element. Eidon says: “It all started from the title, really. “Daffodils”. Nice word, which reminds of many things – an Arcadia of beautiful flowers and their scent, or Wordsworth’s famous poem, for instance. Among the many spurious thoughts that such a word could evoke, there was one that triggered the resolve to create a piece of music from it: the presence of letters that can be interpreted as note names, together with others that can not. Of the many possible mappings, this one was chosen: where ‘real’ notes where used when a music counterpart existed, and `imaginary’ (inaudible) notes otherwise. The singular form led to 8 quavers and an easy 4/4 metre. The result was found sufficiently interesting and worth pursuing, and a composition was started from there. Three voices, initially appointed two two electric guitars and electric bass, with the theme exposed and repeated by the first guitar, soon joined by the cortege of its companions, all moving in an ostinato slow-pace. In retrospective, it is possible that, from the very beginning, it all was leading to Wordsworth’s poem – the choice of the tempo, for instance. Whatever the actual case, at some point it became clear that the connection with “I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud” had to be made explicit. At first we thought to only sing the poem’s final verses; and then Wim had the great idea to recite the whole poem. The track was created with TuxGuitar, a nice tabulature editor whose notes input interfaces include guitar fretboards. So yes all the instruments you can hear in Daffodils have been composed… on guitar ^_^. Some of the sounds were produced via the Timbres Of Heaven soundfont, while for others we used MuseScore, after importing MIDI files exported from TuxGuitar. MuseScore is much more powerful than TuxGuitar. It allows to orchestrate voices from multiple soundfonts at the same time, for instance, and to export the voices as separate audio files. Once the voices have been chosen and isolated, we used Audacity to orchestrate them together. The original TuxGuitar voices were then mixed with MuseScore voices from the Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra, and the Nice Keys Suite soundfonts, plus that of a Steinway piano. Audacity is perhaps not the best tool one could use, though it has certain valuable features. One such feature is so-called Envelope Tool: with it, it is possible to finely control the volume of each voice. This allows fade-ins and fade-outs, and thus can simulate the entrance and exit of instruments. This has been used extensively in Daffodils! “ Wim says: “Eidon wrote this great track “Daffodils” as he explained above, and he sent me a draft and asked if I could recite the verses from Wordsworth’s poem. I don’t know what he thought my voice would contribute to the work, maybe he wanted a Flemish-Scottish accent? Eidon had in mind that I would recite the final two verses only: And then my heart with pleasure fills, And dances with the articles/daffodils. But I misunderstood him, and I recited the entire poem. That turned out to be serendipitous, as we are both happy with the final result. But I’m running ahead of myself. I used my laptop’s built-in mic as that is all I have. The audio quality is acceptable but far from great, so from the start I had this idea that I wanted to apply some distorting effects to the voice. I thought it might work well with the track which is quite modern and rather different from what a more conventional composer might associate with the image of daffodils. I’d never done this before, so it was an interesting experiment. I used Audacity for the recording and for all processing. I recorded the audio in two takes, and combined the best parts. There is nothing to say about the recording: I just read the poem out loud, at a pace that seemed natural to me. First I improved the audio quality. I knew from past experience that a good way to do it is to apply the following effects:Noise Reduction with default settingsEqualisation (Graphic EQ) with the “Bass Boost” presetCompressor with default settingsReverb with the “Vocal I” preset I then also doubled the voice, with a very slight shift between the tracks, so there is no perceptible echo but the sounds is a little bit fuller. Initially I had wanted to use only the vocoder. But Audacity’s Vocoder effect is not quite what I had in mind. The default setting for the Vocoder results in a rather tame distortion. My settings are The result is a bit like speaking through a tube, with added radar needles, a series of short pulses which give a robotic effect. I found that the Phaser could introduce some interesting distortions. Again, the default effect is quite tame. I used the following setting, on a separate copy of the voice track: The result is a space-like oscillator sound overlaying the speech. I was still not happy with the result so I added another copy of the voice track Reverb using the “Church Hall” preset, which gives a huge echoing sound. I combined these three tracks with the original one, taking care that I did not entirely drown out the recitation. I then combined this track with Eidon’s music. I tweaked the pauses between the verses to match the music and tweaked the volume of the voice here and there. The final verses are repeated three times, because somehow I thought that fit with the music. “ Eidon says: “No greater bias than the authors’ opinion, maybe, though we are quite pleased with the results. Music and verse dance together, and hearts with pleasure fill. Therefore, it is likely that this first move into musical/poetical co-creation shall be followed by new experiments soon! “ The track is available on OpenTube: Fuss-free food Updated November 03, 2020 About Blog Terms About Blog Terms © 2020 Jekyll theme Skinny Bones","tags":"","url":"daffodils/index.html"}, {"title":"The four wisdoms","text":" The four wisdoms A friend asked me about if I knew a Japanese Buddhist prayer suitable for a funeral. I knew that at funerals and memorial services, the monks chant Buddhist text in bongo (梵語), a Japanese transliteration of Sanskrit. The practice is known as shōmyō (声明) and a text that is often chanted is called shichi (四智), “the Four Wisdoms”, or shichibongo (四智梵語) in full. The Four Wisdoms text in Japanese Traditionally, shōmyō texts are written using specific and quite unusual Chinese characters, but they are used purely for their phonetic value, not for their meaning. Here is the text in full, from the site of the Buzan sect of Shingon Buddhism. It also has a recording of the chanting. The same text with only very minor differences is used also by the sects of Tendai Buddhism, but I focus here on Shingon only for convenience. The word shingon (真言, lit. “True Words”) is the translation of the Sanskrit word Mantra. From the Japanese text to the original Sanskrit I found the kanji and katakana for this text in a Japanese academic paper on the meaning of the shichibongo: 四智梵語 オム　バザラ　サトバ　ソギャラカ 唵　　嚩日囉　薩怛嚩　蘇蘗　囉賀 バザラ　アラタンノウ　マドタラン 嚩日囉　囉　怛　曩　　摩覩怛覧 バザラ　タラマ　キャヤタイ 嚩日囉　達　麽　誐　夜那 バザラ　キャラマ　キャロ　ハムバ 嚩日囉　羯　　磨　迦　嚕　婆　縛 This transliterates in romaji as: shichibongo om bazara-satoba sogyaraka bazara-aratannou madotaran bazara-tarama kyayatai bazara-kyarama kyaro hamba The same paper also gave the original Sanskrit phrasing, transliterated in the roman alphabet: oṃ vajrasattva samgrahād vajraratnam anuttaraṃ vajradharma gāyanair vajrakarma karo bhava What does the Sanskrit text say? The Sanskrit version allowed me to search for a translation. I found one in a book on Japanese music that discussed shōmyō: Oṃ. Receiving the blessing of the wisdom of Vajra-sattva, we obtain the ultimate vajra-ratna. By chanting the vajra-dharma, we may attain the vajra-karma of enlightenment. I am not familiar with esoteric Buddhism so I found this translation hard to understand. I therefore looked a bit further into this. Some background on esoteric Buddhism First, we need to know about Vajrayana, also know as Esoteric Buddhism, the Buddhist tradition of which Shingon Buddhism is a branch. According to the according to the Encyclopaedia Britannica: Vajrayana, (Sanskrit: “Diamond Vehicle” or “Thunderbolt Vehicle”) form of Tantric Buddhism that developed in India and neighbouring countries, notably Tibet. Vajrayana, in the history of Buddhism, marks the transition from Mahayana speculative thought to the enactment of Buddhist ideas in individual life. The term vajra (Sanskrit: “diamond” or “thunderbolt” ) is used to signify the absolutely real and indestructible in a human being, as opposed to the fictions an individual entertains about himself and his nature; yana is the spiritual pursuit of the ultimately valuable and indestructible. And further: Vajrayana first emerged in various parts of India and Sri Lanka. The esoteric nature of Tantric doctrine and practice makes identifying the origins of the Vajrayana school difficult, but some Buddhist traditions associate them with Nagarjuna and Asanga and therefore suggest that Vajrayana began to develop quietly in the 2nd or 4th century CE. Vajrayana was prominent in India and Tibet, and a form of it spread to China and then to Japan, where it became associated with the Tendai and Shingon schools. Then, we need to know about the concept of the mandala. Again according to the Encyclopaedia Britannica: Mandala, (Sanskrit: “circle”) in Hindu and Buddhist Tantrism, a symbolic diagram used in the performance of sacred rites and as an instrument of meditation. The mandala is basically a representation of the universe, a consecrated area that serves as a receptacle for the gods and as a collection point of universal forces. The Mandala of the Diamond Realm Shingon Buddhism makes frequent use of two mandalas, the Mandala of the Womb Realm and the Mandala of the Diamond Realm (Kongōkai Mandala, 金剛界 曼荼羅). kongō (金剛) means “diamond” or “adamant, and is a translation of the Sanskrit “vajra”. These realms and their composition are based on an esoteric Buddhist sutra called the Vajrasekhara Sutra. The Diamond Realm (金剛界 Kongōkai) is a metaphysical space inhabited by the Five Wisdom Buddhas. In Shingon Buddhism, there is a group of deities, known as the Vajra Bodhisattva. The “Four Wisdoms” refers to the four Vajra Bodhisattva that surround Dainichi Nyorai in the Shiin-e (四印会) section of the Kongōkai Mandala. The Dainichi Nyorai (大日如来) is the Buddha in the highest form of existence, dharmakaya, hosshin (法身) in Japanese. Finally, back to the Four Wisdoms Thus the Four Wisdoms of the text refer to these four Vajra Bodhisattva: Kongōsatta 金剛薩埵 ( Vajra-sattva, “diamond being”) Kongōhō 金剛宝 ( Vajra-ratna, “diamond treasure”) Kongōhō 金剛法 ( Vajra-dharma, “diamond law”) Kongōgyō 金剛業 ( Vadra-karma, “diamond action” ). Kongōsatta 金剛薩埵 ( Vajra-sattva, “diamond being”) Kongōhō 金剛宝 ( Vajra-ratna, “diamond treasure”) Kongōhō 金剛法 ( Vajra-dharma, “diamond law”) Kongōgyō 金剛業 ( Vadra-karma, “diamond action” ). According to the explanation on the site of the Buzan sect, these four bodhisattva are identified with the four wisdom buddha surrounding Dainichi Nyorai in the Five Wisdom Buddhas: “The Four Wisdoms represents the wisdom of the four Wisdom Buddhas, and by making offerings to each other, the Four Wisdoms represent the entire mandala of Vajrayana, with Dainichi Nyorai in the center.” The banner picture is of the Great Buddha of Kamakura.

It was expanded for the second movie, “Innocence”. I was in particular intrigued by the “Puppet Song” in Innocence, and tried to unwrap the many layers behind it. Ghost in the Shell In 1995, the first “Ghost in the Shell” anime was released, based on the 1991 manga koukaku kidoutai (攻殻機動隊, “mobile armoured riot police”) by Shirō Masamune. It’s a cyberpunk, near-future science fiction anime about cyborgs and to my mind it deals with the question of what makes a human human. It is one of my favourite anime, and one of the reasons for this is the score by Kenji Kawai. In particular, the film has a very striking opening theme sung by a choir, “謡I - Making of Cyborg”. The character 謡 (uta) indicates that the song is a traditional folk ballad or chant, otherwise the more common character for “song” 歌 (also uta) would be used. There are three of these chants in the movie, but I want to focus on the first one. Making of Cyborg When listening to this song, what struck me is that it sounds similar to the choral songs of “Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares”, which was the name of a 1975 recording of Bulgarian folk songs performed by the Bulgarian State Radio & Television Female Vocal Choir. It only became widely known after being re-released by the British independent record label 4AD in 1986. As it turns out, this is not a coincidence: in an interview, the composer explained he had wanted a chorus in Bulgarian style but using Japanese folk singers. According to the Japanese Wiki, he used only three singers for the recording. The result is a very interesting combination of a traditional Bulgarian mode with Japanese lyrics and singing style. What is also very interesting is the nature of the song: it is intended to be similar to a traditional Japanese wedding song, but as far as I could gather the composer wrote the lyrics. He used a very archaic style, dating back to the Heian period (794 to 1185, when Kyoto became the capital) or even the earlier Nara period (710 to 794, when Nara was the capital). The original lyrics are: 吾が舞へば 麗し女　酔ひにけり 吾が舞へば　 照る月　響むなり 結婚に　神降りて 夜は明け　鵺鳥　鳴く In hiragana this reads: あがまへば くわしめ　よひにけり あがまへば てるつき　とよむなり よばいに　かみあまくだりて よはあけ　ぬえとりなく And in romaji: agamaeba kuwashime yoinikeri agamaeba terutsuki toyomunari yobai ni amakudarite yo wa ake nuetori naku I based my translation on a modern Japanese version of the archaic Japanese: 私が舞うと　 美しい女が酔った 私が舞うと　 照る月が　鳴り響く 結婚するために　神が天から　降りてきて 夜が明けて　鵺鳥が　鳴く My translation is: As I dance, the beautiful woman is enchanted As I dance, the shining moon reverberates The god descends from heaven to get married The night turns into day and the thrush cries The last words in the song quite dramatically change the atmosphere because of the negative connotations of the cry of the nue. A few notes: “to get married”: the word used in the song is yobai ni, where yo (夜) means “night” and bai (這い) “to crawl”. In the Heian era, a nobleman sneaking into a lady’s bedroom at night constituted a marriage proposal. There are many examples in the famous novel The Tale of Genji. The lyrics in kanji above have “結婚に” (kekkon ni) which means to get married. “The thrush cries”: the specific bird is White’s Thrush. Nowadays, 鵺 nue also refers to a mythological creature, a Japanese version of the chimaera, but that was not the case in the Heian era. Nevertheless, the cry of this bird is an ill omen. “to get married”: the word used in the song is yobai ni, where yo (夜) means “night” and bai (這い) “to crawl”.

Nowadays, 鵺 nue also refers to a mythological creature, a Japanese version of the chimaera, but that was not the case in the Heian era. Nevertheless, the cry of this bird is an ill omen. Innocence In 2004, the second Ghost in the Shell anime, “Innocence”, was released, with the same director (Mamoru Oshii) and continuing the themes from the first movie but with a much more explicit exploration of the philosophical themes through quotes and imagery. Also there are more pronounced archaic elements, for example sometimes the characters use archaic Japanese, and of course there is the famous parade scene. I think this anime is a masterpiece. But my focus is again only on the opening theme song, the Puppet Song. The Puppet Song (I) The full title of the song is kugutsu-uta: uramite chiru (傀儡謡「怨恨みて 散る」, くぐつうた「うらみてちる」) which means “Puppet song: The flowers resentfully fall” (the word “flowers” is not present in the title but implicit from the lyrics). A translation I found in many places is “The flowers grieve and fall” but 怨恨 is not grief but resentment, even hate. The song is in the same choral mode as “Making of Cyborg”. The harmony and delivery are also quite similar but the melody is distinctly different. Musically, another notable difference is that the composer expanded the choir from three singers to 75. The live performance of this song with the full choir is very impressive. The lyrics are written in a similar archaic style, but they are longer and a lot less straightforward. The original lyrics are: 一日一夜に　月は照らずとも 悲傷しみに　鵺鳥　鳴く 吾がかへり 見すれど　花は散りぬべし 慰むる　心は　消ぬるがごとく 新世に　神集いて 夜は明け　鵺鳥　鳴く 咲く花は　神に祈ひ祷む 生ける世に 吾が身悲しも 夢は 消ぬ 怨恨みて 散る In hiragana this reads: ひとひひとよに　つきはてらずとも かなしみに　ぬえとり　なく あがかへり　みすれど　はなはちりぬべし なぐさむる　こころは　けぬるがごとく あらたよに　かむつどいて よはあけ　ぬえとりなく さくはなは　かみにこひのむ いけるよに わがみかなしも　 いめは　けぬ うらみて ちる And in romaji: hitohi hitoyo ni tsuki wa terazu to mo kanashimi ni nuetori naku agakaeri misuredo hana wa chirinubeshi nagusamuru kokoro wa kenuru ga godoku arata yo ni kamu tsudoite yo wa ake nuetori naku sakuhana wa kami ni kohinomu ikeru yo ni wa ga mi kanashi mo ime wa kenu uramite chiru When I tried to read and understand this text, I got stuck on almost every single line. I was quite surprised to find that almost all the parts that I did not understand occur in the Manyōshū. The Manyōshū The Manyōshū (万葉集), literally “Collection of Myriad Leaves”, is the oldest existing collection of poetry in classical Japanese, compiled during the Nara period. It is extremely highly regarded, for example the name of the current era, 令和 (reiwa) was inspired by one of its poems. It has been studied by scholars for a very long time, and therefore it is possible to find explanations and translations of the poems. The Puppet Song (II) In the original lyrics of the Puppet Song above, each linked phrase occurs in a poem from the Manyōshū collection. It’s quite remarkable that the lyrics of the theme song of a cyberpunk science fiction anime are so strongly inspired by 7th-century classical Japanese poetry. I am also intrigued how the composer could write in such an archaic style, which I assume only very few people master today. And of course this explains why I did not understand so many of the lines. However, thanks to the Manyōshū scholars and a number of existing translations, it was possible for me to put together a translation of the song that I’m happy with, although whether it is correct or not is certainly debatable. Every day, every night, even if the moon does not shine, the thrush cries in sadness I turned and looked back, but the flowers had already scattered; all consolation disappeared from my heart The gods leave to gather in the new world As night turns into day, the thrush cries “Although in this living world we ourselves become sad, at least may our dreams never vanish!” the blossoms beseech the gods, as they resentfully fall A few notes: “even if the moon does not shine”: this is my interpretation of とも. “As night turns into day, the thrush cries”: this is a literal quote from the Wedding Song from Ghost in the Shell. “all consolation disappeared from my heart”: this is a bit free, more literally would be “my comforted heart vanishes irrevocably” “does not shine” and “never vanish”: 照らず and 消ぬ are archaic grammar constructions still in current use (-zu and -nu endings) “the blossoms beseech the gods”: the verb used is kohinomu (to pray), and as this scholar explains , it means “to earnestly pray to the gods (for happiness)”. So “beseech” seems more apt than just “pray”. “even if the moon does not shine”: this is my interpretation of とも. “As night turns into day, the thrush cries”: this is a literal quote from the Wedding Song from Ghost in the Shell. “all consolation disappeared from my heart”: this is a bit free, more literally would be “my comforted heart vanishes irrevocably” “does not shine” and “never vanish”: 照らず and 消ぬ are archaic grammar constructions still in current use (-zu and -nu endings) “the blossoms beseech the gods”: the verb used is kohinomu (to pray), and as this scholar explains , it means “to earnestly pray to the gods (for happiness)”.

Each of the dishes does not take long to prepare (15-20 minutes) but requires some soaking time. Two of the dishes use kombu dashi, this is very easy to make but requires some forward planning: put a piece of kombu of about 10 x 10 cm into about 500 ml water and put it in the fridge overnight.  Japanese-style  vegan  gluten-free  45-minutes  • 825 kcal per person   I have written out the recipese for each dish separately, in the order in which I prepared them. The hijiki and shiitake need to be soaked for one hour, and the rice needs an hour in total before cooking as well. After this hour soaking time you can just prepare them in order, or if you want it to be a little bit quicker, you can start the rice and the iridofu when you’ve set the hijiki to simmer. This is another very typical Japanese dish called hourenso no ohitashi (ほうれん草のお浸し), you can find the original recipe at Just One Cookbook and a very quick and easy variant at Just Bento. It is and very easy to make if you have the dashi ready. The preparation time is about 5 minutes but it has to marinate for at least 30 minutes after that so it is not actually quick. For two people: Main ingredients: 1 pack of spinach (200 g) Seasonings half a cup cup dashi 1 tablespoon mirin 1 tablespoon soy sauce Main ingredients: 1 pack of spinach (200 g) Main ingredients: 1 pack of spinach (200 g) 1 pack of spinach (200 g) Seasonings half a cup cup dashi 1 tablespoon mirin 1 tablespoon soy sauce Seasonings half a cup cup dashi 1 tablespoon mirin 1 tablespoon soy sauce half a cup cup dashi 1 tablespoon mirin 1 tablespoon soy sauce Mix the dashi, mirin and soy sauce. Put the spinach in the microwave for 1 minute or at most 90 seconds, so that it is just fully wilted. Rinse under cold water to cool. Then squeeze the juice out of the spinach with your hands and create “logs” of about 10 cm long and 3-4 cm wide. Cut the “logs” into pieces of 2-3 cm and put them in a shallow bowl. Pour over the dashi mixture and let marinate for at least half an hour. Mix the dashi, mirin and soy sauce.

This way to prepare hijiki seaweed is a very common in Japan, and you can find the original recipe for example at Just Bento or at Just One Cookbook.

The final and most substantial dish in this meal is iridoufu (炒り豆腐), another very common dish. It is quite easy and quick to make, in about 15 minutes. The original recipe is from Just Bento.

The paperback version consists of 6 volumes (2 for each Book), 2,057 pages in total. At the end of June 2020, I finally finished the book. I had started learning Japanese in early 2011 in preparation for a research trip. Unfortunately because of the tsunami and the nuclear disaster the trip didn’t go ahead. But I did go to Japan for two months in the summer of 2012 and again in the summer of 2014. So I had been learning Japanese for about four years and had four months of a more or less immersive experience before I started on the book. However, I had been learning Japanese in a rather haphazard, not very systematic way, because I felt it was more fun that way. Nevertheless, I had put in a considerable amount of time and effort. I took some group lessons but they did not continue beyond the very basics. Then I took one-to-one lessons with a Japanese teacher, which was a much better way to learn. The lessons focused on conversation and grammar but we didn’t cover kanji. I started learning kanji using several apps. The one I’ve been using most consistently is Memrise, to study the meanings of the Jouyou kanji. I don’t like mnemonics-based methods like Heisig’s, and I’ve paid the price for that, because apparently with that method you can learn all readings and meanings for all 2,136 Jouyou kanji in a few months. Whereas all these years later, I still have to practise every day. So, what did I learn through reading Murakami? Despite what others may say, I learned that reading Murakami is hard. Initially, a page took me more than half an hour. Now, after six years, it takes me about five minutes, but that is still much lower than my English reading speed: reading the same passage in English only takes a minute. Arguably Murakami’s writing style is comparatively straightforward, and personally I had (even) more difficulty reading Banana Yoshimoto’s “Tokage” than 1Q84, but that doesn’t mean that I found Murakami easy. But I determined, despite that or because of it, not to give up. I kept going, a few pages at a time. Eventually I got there. I found that reading with a dictionary and looking up the readings and meanings of any character or word I didn’t know is not only wonderfully engaging but also really works as a way to learn Japanese. My reading skills have improved dramatically, and so have my vocabulary and my grasp of grammar. As a result, my writing, listing and speaking skills have also improved. So on the whole, I would recommend reading a Japanese novel as a way of learning Japanese, if you are not in a hurry. On the other hand, I also learned I still have so much to learn. I still don’t know all readings for the Jouyou kanji, and keep forgetting the meanings. I still struggle with conversation (although that may partly be as a result of my tendency of overcomplicating things and wanting to be too precise) and with handwriting. I started handwriting practice in 2018. It requires a better understanding of the structure of the kanji, but it is fun and my recall is improving. I still have a long way to go before I’ll be able to write all Jouyou kanji. I have written down some of my observations before: Reading Murakami in Japanese, Some tips for reading Japanese as a learner, My journey of learning Japanese. One specific thing I started noticing only when reading the last two volumes of 1Q84 is that, when I see a word and I think I can’t pronounce it, often it turns out I can after all, if I just make a little more effort, a kind of mental jump into the unknown. There is a wonderful Japanese expression for this: Kiyomizu no butai kara tobioriru 清水の舞台から飛び降りる (きよみずのぶたいからとびおりる) which literally translates as “to jump off the platform of the Kiyomizu-dera temple”, but means “to make a leap into the dark”. (The platform of the beautiful and ancient Kiyomizu-dera temple in Kyoto offers great views but is also twelve metres high, so jumping off it may not be a good idea.) Recall is sometimes more about daring rather than about remembering: rather than going for conscious recall, trust your unconscious mind to pick the right reading. You actually remember more than you think you remember. You may wonder: having spent nearly six years reading it, do I think it is a good book? I do. It was certainly for the most part entertaining and interesting. I have written three posts about various remarkable points in the book (Repetition in Murakami’s 1Q84, Why the ‘Little People’ say ‘Ho ho’, and Cold or not: a riddle in Murakami’s 1Q84). Are there aspects I don’t like? Yes. The ending leaves me wanting to know what happened to the other characters. Also, there is a bit too much repetition, which I think is a consequence of the book being published in three parts, and in every part Murakami (or his publisher) has felt it necessary to provide sufficient background on what happened before so that each part can be read on its own. There are some parts that I found a bit slow, because I was impatient to get back to the plot, but usually even these parts were actually quite interesting. And finally, will I ever re-read it? Maybe, if my Japanese reading speed ever gets close to my English one.

The focus of this post is on how I’m learning and what tools I’ve been using. I think that the most important factor in learning Japanese is not to give up, to keep working at it steadily, even if it’s only a few minutes every day. This is probably true for learning any language, but I think more so for Japanese because of the need to learn kanji. When I started (in 2011), I used JapanesePod101, and I really think that for absolute beginners it is a very good way to start. I listened to the podcasts on my way to work and found that quite effective. The audio lessons also come with written material covering vocabulary and grammar and the JapanesePod101 YouTube channel has a very large collection of videos. Apart from that I also used Tae Kim’s Guide to Learning Japanese, especially the grammar guide. I learned this way for about a year, but then I decided I wanted to focus more on reading and less on listening, so I started learning kanji. (To practise conversation I get a two-hour lesson with a Japanese teacher every two weeks.) I try to do at least 5 minutes of kanji practice per day. That really isn’t much, and yet it was sufficient to learn the 2,000 common use (Jouyou,常用) kanji in about four years. As I wrote in my earlier post, by summer 2012 I only knew about 100 kanji, and I finished the Jouyou series before the start of last summer. I still do my daily kanji practice because unless I revise I easily forget them. I have an Android phone, and initially I used Anki, then Simple Kanji Quiz, but I felt that I made most progress when I started using Memrise. I still use Simple Kanji Quiz because it is very configurable but what I like about Memrise is its goalsetting. It’s quite rewarding to reach your daily goal after five minutes! I looked at WaniKani as well because I love Tofugu, but WaniKani only works if you start from scratch so by the time it came out I had already learned most of the basic kanji. I have thought quite a lot about the best ways to learn but in the end I’ve decided not to be very systematic. For example, my Memrise deck only tests if I know the meaning of a kanji, not its on and kun readings. I have set up my Simple Kanji Quiz to practise readings both ways. So for a given kanji I’m either practising meaning or reading but not both at the same time. My only kanji handwriting practice is looking up kanji on my phone (I use Kanji Draw but the Japanese app is also very good). Handwriting kanji on paper takes a lot of time, and unless you live in Japan I don’t think it is an essential skill. To expand my vocabulary my main approach is reading. I also sometimes listen to podcasts or Japanese music, or watch anime or Japanese movies, and of course I should learn new words while talking to my teacher. But I don’t really spend time in memorising new words, I just let it happen. I found that encountering words in different contexts is a great way to learn. For example, a few days ago I read the word でかい (huge) in a blog post, and then I heard it used in the anime Spirited Away. Now I’m pretty sure I will remember this word.　 But what really works best for me to build vocabulary is to go to Japan, so of course I would strongly recommend that. The constant immersion works wonders. Many words I remember because I see in my mind the situation where I first encountered them.　 Fuss-free food Updated December 22, 2017 About Blog Terms About Blog Terms © 2020 Jekyll theme Skinny Bones","tags":"","url":"more-on-articles/learning-japanese/index.html"}, {"title":"Drawing the dancer of Ranryōō","text":" Drawing the dancer of Ranryōō Some years ago I was at the yoiyama (宵山) – or maybe the yoiyoiyama (宵々山), or even the yoiyoiyoiyama (宵々々山) – in any case, the eve of the Gion Matsuri (祇園祭), Kyoto’s most famous festival. I came across a traditional dance performance and took some pictures, one of them is the banner for this post. This summer I wanted to make a drawing with a Japanese theme and I selected that picture. Before starting on the drawing, I felt I had to find out more about the dance. Most of what follows is taken from the page about Ryōō 陵王 on the Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System and the Japanese Wikipedia page about Ranryōō (蘭陵王), with some additional information from this New York Public Library blog article. The legend The most common interpretation of the dance is that it celebrates the victory of Prince Lanling (Ranryōō, 蘭陵王) of Pohai (北斉 , Manchuria) over the Zhou dynasty, around 550 A.D. He was a general named Gao Changgong who was given a fiefdom in Lanling, so he was also known as the Prince of Lanling. The Prince of Lan Ling was one of the four most handsome men in ancient Chinese history. A masterful warrior, he led his army into battle and vanquished his foes while wearing a fearsome Ryōō mask to hide his beauty. His most famous battle was the breaking of the siege of Jinyong (金墉, near modern Luoyang) in 564 A.D. Gao Changgong led only 500 cavalrymen and fought through an army of Northern Zhou, which was attacking the city with 100,000 soldiers. He fought his way to the gates the city, surprising the defenders. The soldiers of Jinyong didn’t recognize him, so he took off his helmet and mask. The soldiers in the city rejoiced at his arrival and their courage returned. They opened the gates and joined the battle outside the city. Soon the army of Northern Zhou was defeated. To celebrate the victory, the soldiers composed the famous song and dance “Prince Lanling in Battle” (兰陵王入阵曲). The tradition There are variations on the legend: some say that the prince wore the mask himself to frighten his enemies, others that his father’s ghost appeared wearing the mask. Others trace the dance back to the Eight Dragon Kings (hachidai ryuuou 八大竜王) of the Buddhist Lotus Sutra. Following this latter tradition, folk festivals in Japan since the 13th century often incorporate the dance of Ran-ryou-ou as a rain prayer, as dragons are associated with water. This may partly account for the great popularity of the dance. The dance The dance is called ranryouou nyuujinkyoku (蘭陵王入陣曲) “The song of Prince Lan-Ling going into Battle”. It is a traditional Japanese court dance or bugaku (舞楽) introduced in the Japanese Imperial courts in the 9th century, and performed to traditional Japanese court music or gagaku (雅楽). For much of its history, bugaku was an exclusive and privileged experience, performed only at the Japanese imperial court and, very rarely, as part of religious rituals at temples or shrines. In those days (the Heian era) the imperial court was organized with a strict Left and Right division. In terms of culture, poetry, music and dance, the Left was associated with China or India and the Right with Korea. Costumes for dances of the Left are primarily red. The music, tougaku (唐楽) is a Japanese adaptation of Chinese musical styles prevalent during the T’ang Dynasty. The Ranryōō is a dynamic dance of the Left (sa-no-mai 左舞) and it is originally from either China or Southeast Asia (rin’yuugaku 林邑楽). It is performed by one person dressed in a fringed tunic and pantaloons (ryoutou shouzoku 裲襠装束). The mask or bugakumen (舞楽面) is of a fierce, mythical golden beast with a dragon perched on its head. The mask Although Ranryōō masks can look vary different, they all share a common set of features: a sharp, long nose; bulging, rotating eyes (dougan 動眼); a gaping mouth with huge teeth and dangling chin (tsuriago 吊顎); wrinkles that line the face and the carved strands of heavy hair above the forehead. The golden face and metallic eyes are offset by the blue-green hair and vermilion mouth. There are tufts of animal hair suggestive of eyebrows, a moustache and beard. On the top of the head perches a crouching dragon. I found an interesting blog post (in Japanese) by a Ranryōō dancer, where he compares various masks from his own collection. The drawing I wanted to make a drawing with bright colours and a lot of detail, and also I prefer to draw human figures, but I didn’t want to do a portrait. So this Ranryōō dancer was a perfect match. I replaced the audience with people in yukata (浴衣, a light summer kimono) to make the scene more homogeneous. For most of the yukata designs I used my own pictures but the designs of the central four figures are based on the yukata worn by the sisters in Hirokazu Kore-eda’s wonderful movie “海街 diary” (“Our little sister”). The main focus is of course the dancer, so I drew and coloured the musicians and audience in a much more sketchy way. The paper for this drawing is Arches 56cm x 76cm 300g/m2 “rough” watercolour paper. It’s a really nice paper with a pronounced grain and absorbs the water really well. As I did not tape it on a board, the sheet of course buckled a bit. I used Derwent Inktense and Conté Aquaralle pencils as well as watercolour paint (various brands). The Inktense pencils give a very saturated colour. It was the first time I used them but I really like them. I started the drawing as usual with a pencil ghost drawing. Because of the size of the drawing, I used a grid to make sure the figure was positioned correctly. Then I added a first layer of detail and colour with the watercolour pencils. Next I started to detail and wash the mask. I needed a very fine pencil and a magnifying glass for the eyes. Then I worked on the tunic in the same way. Next I did the trousers, which took a long time, and the sleeves, ending the first full pass of the entire figure. Then I worked on the detail of the yukata of the figures in the background, which I decided to do in indigo blue for all of them. Usually I use a relatively blunt pencil because in general that works better on coarse-grained paper, but to render the patterns on the fabric with very fine lines before washing them I used an extra-sharp pencil. Next I added more detail and colour to the musicians, but I left them quite sketchy on purpose. Then I put a second layer of colour on the dancer, to make the red and orange more vibrant, and make the shadows more pronounced. I used a mixture of watercolour paint and watercolour pencils. Finally I did another pass of the entire drawing. I added more colour to the background figures but made them darker at the same time, as they are actually in the shadow. Adding the shadow layer was tricky because I could not just wash the entire background with a darker tint, as it would make the colours run. Instead, I used a layer of colour pencil. I added still more colour to the dancer, especially to the sleeves, again using a mixture of watercolour paint and watercolour pencils. To finish the drawing I added a description in Japanese, “蘭陵王　雅楽公演　祇園祭”, which means “Ranryoo, public bugaku performance, Gion matsuri”.

(It’s now July 2016 and I’ve finally finished the first volume!) This post is about reading Japanese. I’ll give some tips on how to look up kanji and a few handy rules to simplify the reading process. I haven’t really encountered these tips and rules as such in my learning materials, so I thought they may be of interest to other learners as well. When learning to read in a language that uses an alphabet, you can simply look up any word you don’t know in a dictionary. Because of the use of kanji (漢字, Chinese characters), things are more complicated for the learner of Japanese. Words written in katakana or hiragana (the sets of about fifty characters used to write Japanese phonetically) are easy to look it up. But what to do with kanji? There are about two thousand kanji in general use. Learning them all takes a long time: in the Japanese school system, it takes nine years. Typically each kanji has several possible readings (pronunciation) and meanings. And knowing every meaning of every kanji does not mean knowing the meaning of words that use combinations of kanji. For me, reading for learning is different from ordinary reading. Normally, I read to understand the meaning of a text. When learning Japanese, I also want to learn the readings of the kanji I encounter and I want to practise recall of the kanji and compound words that I’ve already learnt. Usually I make a first pass through a page of the text without looking anything up, trying to remember as much as possible, both readings and meanings, and to guess at readings and meanings of compound words where possible. Very often the context helps to guess at meanings, so I make sure to read enough text to get sufficient context. Then in a second pass I look up every kanji for which I don’t know either the reading or the meaning, and every compound word that I don’t know. I find that the most convenient way to look up a kanji is an electronic dictionary on a smartphone, because I need to know just one of the readings. If I don’t know any of the readings, I use three different ways, depending on the kanji. All of them require understanding of the basics of kanji writing and structure: the stroke order, stroke count and the “radicals”, the kanji building blocks that make up the more complex kanji. The first way is to draw the kanji stroke by stroke. I prefer this approach as a learner, because I tend to remember the kanji better if I’ve had to write it. Typically, a kanji writing app will present a list of kanji that match the handwritten one. If my writing was good, I’ll get the kanji I was looking for on the first page. The second approach is to look up the kanji by radical. Most electronic dictionaries offer that facility. It usually works well if the radicals making up the kanji are clear. It really helps to know how to count the strokes in a radical, because they are usually ordered by stroke count. My final way is to use a (paper) dictionary with the SKIP (System of Kanji Indexing by Patterns) system for ordering kanji. I have the well-known “Kodansha Kanji Learner’s Dictionary”. The SKIP method is based on first classifying the kanji into one of 4 groups (Left-Right ◧, Up-Down ⬒, Enclosure ◻, and Solid ◼). For the first two categories, further indexing is by stroke count of both parts. Kanji in the third category (enclosure) are indexed by the number of sides of the enclosure. Kanji in the last category typically can’t always be broken down, but there aren’t that many of them and most of them are simple kanji. The first way is to draw the kanji stroke by stroke.

Kanji in the last category typically can’t always be broken down, but there aren’t that many of them and most of them are simple kanji. Although the many readings and meanings may sound horribly complicated, I found that there are actually a few general rules that simplify the reading process. Of course there are exceptions to all of these rules but they hold most of the time. Kanji have typically two types of readings, called on (音,”sound”) and kun (訓,”instruction” or “explanation”). The on-reading is based on the sound of the original Chinese reading of a character; the kun-reading is the Japanese word with the same meaning. Chinese used to play a similar role as Latin or Greek in ancient Japan, so in a way on-readings are comparable with words with a Latin or Greek root in English. The first general rule is that kanji appearing on their own (i.e. not in combination with other kanji) have almost always the kun-reading. For example, for the kanji 食, it will be one of the four kun-readings (く.う “ku-u”, く.らう “ku-rau”, た.べる “ta-beru” or は.む “ha-mu”), not one of the on-readings. To select the correct kun-reading, look at the hiragana following the kanji so 食う is pronounced as “kuu” and 食べる is pronounced as “taberu”. The second general rule is that in a compound word, all kanji have either the on- or the kun-reading. And for the vast majority of the compound words, it will be the on-reading. For example, 食事 is shokuji (on-_on_), not “ta-ji” (kun-_on_) or “shoku-koto” (on-_kun_). Generally, there are fewer on-readings than kun-readings for a kanji, and on-readings are also mostly single-syllable. Although there are indeed many on- and kun-readings, for most kanji one of each will be the most frequently used, and the others will likely be used only in fixed combinations. The same is true for meanings: usually one of the meanings is used much more frequently than all the others.

Even if reading a Japanese text may seem daunting at first, it is a very rewarding experience, and it is actually less complicated than it seems. I hope these tips and rules will help you to read Japanese more easily.

I read the English translation when it was first published but I had never looked up any reviews. The Japanese paperback comes in six volumes and after finishing the third volume*, I decided to check some reviews, and I was somewhat surprised to find that most critics didn’t like the book very much. One of the recurrent criticisms is that the characters repeat one another frequently. This is in particular the case for the conversations between Tengo and Fuka-eri. Murakami mentions that Fuka-eri has dyslexia and based on her behaviour and speech it is likely that she also has autistic spectrum disorder (Murakami describes her speech as monotonous or flat, and she clearly prefers to use single words, although she can speak in full sentences; her facial expression is impossible to read; there are many more hints like this). In Japanese, Murakami uses a specific writing style to express Fuka-eri’s way of speaking. Japanese has three sets of characters: hiragana and katakana which are phonetic alphabets, and Chinese characters (kanji). In general, kanji are used to indicate the meaning of words, hiragana is used to express the grammar and katakana is used for foreign words or as a kind of italics. Japanese has few distinct sounds, there are lots of homonyms, and the kanji disambiguate the meanings for the homonyms. However, katakana and hiragana can be used to phonetically write kanji but sentences without kanji can be difficult to read, especially because no spaces are used between words. Murakami renders Fuka-eri’s speech using hiragana and katakana characters only, without kanji. For example: 「セキブンのはなしはおもしろかった」 「予備校の僕の講義のこと？」 ふかえりは肯いた。 「君は数学は好き？」 ふかえりは短く首を振った。数学は好ではない。 「でも積分の話は面白かったんだ？」と天語は尋ねた。 In the English translation by Jay Rubin, the exchange is: ‘The calculus part was good.’ ‘You mean in my lecture?’ Fuka-eri nodded. ‘Do you like math?’ She gave her head a quick shake. She did not like math. ‘But the part about calculus was good? he asked.’ Even though the translator has changed the wording slightly, the last sentence still mostly repeats the first. When written in roman alphabet, the first and the last sentence of the Japanese dialogue are virtually identical: ‘sekibun no hanashi wa omoshirokatta’ ‘demo sekibun no hanashi wa omoshirokatta?’ However, although the pronunciation is word for word identical, the effect in the original Japanese text is different because the first sentence, said by Fuka-eri, is written only in hiragana and katakana characters, while the last sentence, said by Tengo, uses kanji. For example, while sekibun has only one meaning, the seki in sekibun could mean amongst others “stone” or “seat” or “red”; bun could mean amongst others　”minute”, “sentence” or “mosquito”. Without the kanji it is harder for the reader, and requires more context, to work out the meaning. Furthermore, Japanese has the particular grammar feature of particles (joshi, 助詞). These are suffixes or short words that immediately follow a noun, verb, adjective, or sentence and can act as conjunctions, prepostions or modifiers. Some of these particles are attached at the very end of the sentence to add an emotion or tone, or convey that the sentence is a question. Fuka-eri never uses those sentence-ending particles, and in particular the question marking particle. As her speech is uninflected, and the word order in Japanese is the same for statements and questions, it is not always clear if she is asking a question or just stating something. For example: 「わたしをだきたくない」とふかえりは疑問符抜きで尋ねた。 ‘watashi wo dakitakunai’ to fukaeri wa gimonfunuki de tazuneta. Which Jay Rubin translates as: ‘You don’t want to hold me,’ Fuka-eri asked without a question mark. Because of the lack of question mark or particle, there is no way to know if this is a question or not. A proper Japanese sentence would have been either「私を抱きたくないか」or 「私を抱きたくない？」and indeed, Tengo says: 「君を抱く？」 ‘Hold you?’ The lack of kanji and particles means that Fuka-eri’s sentences in Japanese are often quite ambiguous. So when Tengo repeats Fuka-eri’s sentences, he’s making sure that he understands her correctly, but Murakami also uses this to clarify to the reader what she’s just said. For example, 「イヘンがあろうとしている」 「イヘン」と天吾は言った。それが「異変」であると思い当たるまでに少し時間がかかった。 ‘ihen ga arou toshite iru’ ‘ihen’ to tengo wa itta. sore ga ‘ihen’ de aru to omoiataru made ni sukoshi jikan ga kakatta. The meaning of “ihen” (イヘン) is not clear when written in katakana. In fact, a possible meaning of the sentence could be ‘You’ll have a leather cord’. The Japanese sentence actually says that it takes a while for Tengo to realise that “ihen”,イヘン means ”something unusual”,異変. In the English translation, this becomes ‘That something extra ordinary is starting.’ It took Tengo a moment to realize this meant “extraordinary”. Jay Rubin has left out the sentence ‘ihen’ to tengo wa itta. He could have translated it as ‘Extra ordinary’ said Tengo, but that would have made the exchange even more repetitive. In the Japanese version of 1Q84, the exchanges with Fuka-eri are my favourite parts. Her sentences are very easy to read, except for the lack of kanji; then Tengo’s paraphrasing puts in the kanji as well. So as a learner I get both the reading and the meaning. Another example: 「わたしはここにのこっている」とふかえりは言った。 「君はここに残っている」と天語は反復した。 ‘watashi wa koko ni nokotte iru’ to fukaeri wa itta. ‘kimi wa koko ni nokotte iru’ to tengo wa hanpuku shita. The translation says: ‘I’ll stay here,’ Fuka-eri said. ‘You’ll stay here,’ Tengo echoed her. Again, this looks more repetitive than the original. The English translation of the first two books is by Jay Rubin, who is very renowned for translating Murakami’s works, and I think his translation of 1Q84 is excellent. However, the repetition in the English translation is fundamentally different from the Japanese original because of the writing system. It is impossible to translate the effect of the difference between words writtin in hiragana, katakana and kanji into a language with a single alphabet-based writing system like English.     *After four years of reading.

It’s a very nice but difficult novel, I may write more about it later. After I wrote the article on the Buddhist prayer “The Four Wisdoms”, I came across a passage in the novel that describes a Buddhist funeral and it contains a prayer used by the Jōdo Shinshū (浄土真宗, “The True Essence of the Pure Land Teaching”), known as Shinshū in Japan. The prayer The prayer in the book is written in archaic Japanese with old forms of kanji and grammar and uncommon words: 　 　 　 　 長 本 浄 娑 ツ 佛 イ 弘 　 　 　 　 時 師 土 婆 子 恩 ヅ 誓 　 　 　 　 ニ 釋 无 永 ニ フ レ ノ 　 　 　 　 慈 迦 爲 劫 弥 カ ノ チ 　 　 　 　 恩 ノ ヲ ノ 陀 ク ト カ 　 　 　 　 ヲ チ 期 苦 ヲ オ キ ラ 　 　 　 　 報 カ ス ヲ 念 モ ニ ヲ 　 　 　 　 ズ ラ ル ス ズ ヒ カ カ 　 　 　 　 ベ ナ コ テ ベ ツ 娑 フ 　 　 　 　 シ リ ト 、 シ 、 婆 ラ 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 ヲ ズ 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 い バ 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 デ 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 ン The puzzle I could not understand the poem, but I was curious about its meaning so I tried to find out. First of all, here is a list of the special kanji, words and constructions that I did not understand: 弘誓 (ぐぜい, guzei): Buddha’s universal vow 娑婆 (しゃば, shaba): The Sahā world, the mundane world. 佛: an older form of 仏 (butsu), Buddha 仏恩 (ブツオン、ぶっとん, button): Buddha’s blessings, the grace of Buddha’s compassion 弥陀 (みだ,mida): Amitabha (a celestial Buddha, the principal buddha in Pure Land Buddhism) 永劫 (えいごう, here pronounced yōgō): Eternity, perpetuity. 劫 (kō or gō) means kalpa. 浄土 (じょうど, jōdo): Lit. “pure land”, esp. the Western Pure Land paradise of Amitabha. 无爲: old kanji for 無為 mui: asaṃskṛta, the ‘unconditioned’, a term referring to anything that transcends conditioned (saṃskṛta) existence in the state of saṃsāra. 期スル (ごする,go suru): to live 本師 (ホンシ,honshin): Lit. “fundamental guru”, i.e. Buddha 釋: an older form of 釈, lit. shaka, short for Shakamuni (釈迦牟尼), the historical Buddha. 慈恩 (じおん_jion_): deep compassion, benevolence ナリ: なり (nari) is the classical version of である, “to be”. ベシ: べし (beshi) is the classical version of べき, “something one ought to do”. In the prayer, 念 ずべし means 念 ずるべき,”should pray”, and 報 ずべし means 報 ずるべき, “should inform”. 弘誓 (ぐぜい, guzei): Buddha’s universal vow 娑婆 (しゃば, shaba): The Sahā world, the mundane world. 佛: an older form of 仏 (butsu), Buddha 仏恩 (ブツオン、ぶっとん, button): Buddha’s blessings, the grace of Buddha’s compassion 弥陀 (みだ,mida): Amitabha (a celestial Buddha, the principal buddha in Pure Land Buddhism) 永劫 (えいごう, here pronounced yōgō): Eternity, perpetuity. 劫 (kō or gō) means kalpa. 浄土 (じょうど, jōdo): Lit. “pure land”, esp. the Western Pure Land paradise of Amitabha. 无爲: old kanji for 無為 mui: asaṃskṛta, the ‘unconditioned’, a term referring to anything that transcends conditioned (saṃskṛta) existence in the state of saṃsāra. 期スル (ごする,go suru): to live 本師 (ホンシ,honshin): Lit. “fundamental guru”, i.e. Buddha 釋: an older form of 釈, lit. shaka, short for Shakamuni (釈迦牟尼), the historical Buddha. 慈恩 (じおん_jion_): deep compassion, benevolence ナリ: なり (nari) is the classical version of である, “to be”. ベシ: べし (beshi) is the classical version of べき, “something one ought to do”. In the prayer, 念 ずべし means 念 ずるべき,”should pray”, and 報 ずべし means 報 ずるべき, “should inform”. With these terms and the furigana in the novel, I could do a transcription in romaji: guzei no chikara wo kafurazuba idzure no toki ni ka shaba wo iden button fukaku omohitsu, tsune ni mida wo nen zubeshi shaba yōgo no ku wo sute, jōdo mui wo go suru koto honshi shaka no chikara nari jōji ni jion wo hō zubeshi So at least I can now pronounce the prayer, and I get a rough idea of the meaning. But of course I wanted to know the details. The origin By searching for snippets rewritten with modern kanji and hiragana, I found that the prayer is taken from a book of hymns called Kōsō Wasan (『高僧和讃』, the “Japanese Hymns of Praise of the Virtuous Priest”), a collection of hymns written by the founder of the sect, Shinran (親鸞), who lived between 1173 and 1263 and was a remarkable person. In particular, these are the two final hymns from “Twenty-six Hymns based on the Writings of Master Shan-tao”. Shan-tao is one of the seven masters (patriarchs) of Shinshū. He lived from 613 to 681 and is generally credited for popularizing the nembutsu as the reciting of Amida’s name (see below). The meaning The complete works of Shinran in English translation are available on line. The translation of the two hymns taken from there is: Had we not received the power of the universal Vow, When can we part from this Saha world? Reflecting deeply on the Buddha’s benevolence, Let us think on Amida always. Casting off long kalpas of painful existence in this world of Saha, We live in expectation of the Pure Land, the uncreated; That is the power of our teacher, Shakyamuni; Let us respond always in gratitude for his compassion and benevolence. Pure Land Buddhism holds that there is a kind of Paradise called the Pure Land, and once one is there it is easier to reach Nirvana. Shinran advocated to trust to the power of Amitābha (Amida), as made manifest in his Universal Vow, to attain enlightenment. The main Jōdo Shinshū practice is called nembutsu, “Mindfulness of the Buddha”. The nembutsu is simply reciting the phrase Namu Amida Butsu (“I take refuge in Amitābha Buddha”, written 南無阿弥陀佛). For more information see the detailed discussion of the meaning of the hymns. The conclusion This is yet another example of how reading Japanese remains a difficult but very stimulating activity for me: there are lots of riddles to be solved. In translation, most of the mystery disappears. And every time I look into such a little mystery, I learn lots of new things. The banner picture is of the Nishi Hongan-ji (本願寺, Temple of the Primal Vow)) in Kyōto, the largest of all the Jōdo Shinshū branches.

At first glance this seems a very long, hard to pronounce and difficult to remember name, so why name a shop like that? The names of the planets in the solar system The explanation is that the name refers to a mnemonic for the planets in the solar system: each kanji in the name of the shop is the first kanji of the name of a planet, starting from the one closest to the sun. So most Japanese people will recognise and remember the name. And because in Japanese everything gets abbreviated if at all possible, in practice everyone calls the shop “Suikin”. One oddity about the name is that most people will in school have learned the sequence Sui Kin Chi Ka Moku Do Ten Kai Mei ( 水金地火木土天海冥), so the last two names are swapped. This is because when the shop was founded (in 1984), Pluto (冥王星, meiōsei) was closer to the earth than Neptune (海王星, kaiōsei), but because of Pluto’s strongly elliptical orbit, this is only the case for two periods of about 20 years in the total of 248 year it takes to complete one orbit around the Sun. The last time this happened was between 1979 and 1999, and it won’t happen again until 2227. What puzzled me is the connection between the order of the planets and the order of the days of the week in Japanese. The names of the planets are: Table 1. Names of the planets in English and Japanese The suffix -sei (星) actually means “star”. The names of the last three planets are Japanese descriptions of the roles of the gods Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The other five planets are named after the Five Elements (五大, godai) used in Chinese philosophy: water (水), metal (金), fire (火), wood (木), and earth in the sense of soil (土). The days of the week are listed in Table 2. The suffix -yōbi (曜日) means “weekday”. I’ve added the names used in the Roman calendar for comparison. Table 2. Names of the days of the week in English and Japanese and their Roman name The order of the days of the week What I found intriguing is that the days of the week occur in the same order in our calendar and in the Japanese calendar. My first assumption was that the Japanese simply borrowed the Western convention after contact with the West, which would have been in the 16th century at the earliest, but it turns out that this is not the case: the adoption of a 7-day week and the naming of the weekdays was introduced in China in the 4th century (from either ancient Mesopotamia or Egypt, and likely via Greece) and from there in Japan in the 9th century. I found the answer on the website of the Sendai Astronomical Observatory (Sendaishi Tenmondai, 仙台市天文台). What follows is a rewording of that explanation. In ancient times, people read the time and season from the stars in the night sky. They discovered that five of these “stars” were moving in a strange way, overtaking each other and sometimes appearing to move backwards. They called these wakusei (惑星), literally “perplexing stars”. These are the five planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn that can be seen with the naked eye. The ancients thought that planets, the sun and the moon were turning around the earth. As a result of their observations they thought the moon was closest to the earth followed by Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn: Furthermore, the belief was that the sun, the moon, and the five planets were “star gods” (星の神, hoshi no kami) who dominated time and space. And the astronomers observed the moon cycle of 28 days, which was split into four 7-day units, with one day dedicated to each star god. This was the basis for the notion of the ​”week”. The division of the day into 24 hours had already evolved based on the concept of the twelve constellations of the zodiac. Each hour was believed to be controlled by a specific star god, and each day was believed to be dominated by the specific star god controlling the first hour of that day. And the order in which the star gods were assigned to the hours and days was based on the order in which the “stars” were observed. If we start on the first hour of the first day with Saturn, the planet furthest away from the earth, this is Saturn’s day (土曜日). Each hour we move to the next closer planet in the geocentric model: Jupiter, Mars, the Sun,Venus, Mercury and the Moon, and we repeat this process, so after the Moon we start again with Saturn. Doing so, after 24 hours, we arrive at the Sun (日曜日), and 24 hours after that, the Moon (月曜日), then Mars (火曜日), Mercury (水曜日), Jupiter (木曜日), Venus (金曜日), and after one week, this pattern repeats itself and we’re back at Saturn: This is how the ancient astronomers in Mesopotamia or Egypt related the days of the week to the planets, and from there it was adopted in ancient Greece and Rome but also in ancient China and Japan. To my mind it’s really quite amazing to learn that the order of the days of the week relates in this way to the ordering of the “stars” in the geocentric model. Bonus track Here is a small Haskell program that creates the week day sequences from the sequence of the “star gods”: The program performs the operations explained above: it takes the list of “star gods” in geocentric order and reverses them so that “土” (Saturn) is first, this is starGodSequence. It then repeats this list forever (in Haskell you can do this). The concat flattens this list of lists into a single list, starGodsAllHours. The function starGodsDaysFrom is recursive, what it does is take the first element in a list, then drops 24 elements (including this first one), and repeats the process, again potentially forever. We apply this function to starGodsAllHours. This produces a new list which repeats the days of the week forever. Finally, to get the seven days of the week, we take the first seven elements of that new list. The banner photo shows the moon-viewing room (shōgetsurō, 嘯月楼) of the Shisen-dō (詩仙堂) temple in Kyoto. Fuss-free food Updated September 08, 2019 About Blog Terms About Blog Terms © 2020 Jekyll theme Skinny Bones","tags":"","url":"articles/suikin-planets-weekdays/index.html"}, {"title":"On puppets and being human","text":" On puppets and being human Ghost in the Shell is a series of Japanese animated movies (anime,アニメ) featuring cyborgs (“cybernetic organism”, in this case a human with both organic and robotic body parts). I was struck by the frequent references to puppets in several of the movies, and I want to explore the symbolism behind this. I will look in particular at the movies “Ghost in the Shell”, “Innocence” and “Solid State Society”, because in these movies the references are most clear. Familiarity with the movies is not required. Puppets, dolls, marionettes, mannequins I use the word puppet as the most general word. A doll to my mind is a puppet used as a child’s toy. A marionette is a puppet with strings to manipulate it. And a mannequin is a puppet in the sense that it is a representation of a human. I would say that the crucial property is that a puppet is somewhat articulated or can be made to move. In Japanese there are also several words for puppets and dolls. The most common word is ningyō, 人形 , “doll, puppet”. The word nin means person and gyō means form, shape. Specifically, ayatsuriningyō, 操り人形, sometimes shortened to just ayatsuri, 操り, means a puppet controlled by an operator, e.g. a marionette. The word ayatsuri means “manipulation”. The other word that is used in Ghost in the Shell is kairai or kugutsu, 傀儡, this is an older word and not so common (neither of the kanji is in common use). It is an interesting word because both its characters mean “puppet”. The first, 傀, is composed of “person” and “ghost”; the second is likely simply a variant, and is only used in this word. The reading kugutsu apparently derives from kugu, 久具, a plant from which the baskets were woven that were used to transport the puppets by itinerant puppet players. Cyberbrains and ghosts In the Ghost in the Shell series, one of the main themes that is being explored is what defines a human. A cyborg is a human with all or parts of its body replaced by artificial components. In the Ghost in the Shell universe, even the brain can be treated this way, being augmented by a cyberbrain (dennō,電脳), essentially an electronic system with a similar functionality, but connected to the net). In the most extreme case, the entire human brain is replaced by a cyberbrain which contains the content of the original human brain. By contrast, robots do not start out human. The difference between a robot and a full-cyborg human is only the origin of the data in the brain. In Ghost in the Shell, the word ghost is colloquial slang for an individual’s consciousness or soul, which is what sets it apart from a robot. Part of the plot of the second movie, “Innocence”, is that robots get a ghost through a process called “ghost dubbing”, i.e. copying the ghost from a human and putting it into the robot cyberbrain. This idea returns in the recent “Arise” series. A brief note on the characters In this article I will mention a few characters from the series who belong to a kind of special state intelligence unit called “Public Security Section 9” (公安９課): “The Major”, Motoko Kusanagi, a female cyborg, the main character in the series. Batō, a male cyborg, the protagonist in “Innocence”. Togusa, a human with a cyberbrain, the companion of Batō in “Innocence”. “The Major”, Motoko Kusanagi, a female cyborg, the main character in the series. Batō, a male cyborg, the protagonist in “Innocence”. Togusa, a human with a cyberbrain, the companion of Batō in “Innocence”. Furthermore, I mention a character from “The Individual Eleven” series, Hideo Kuze, a male cyborg, a very charismatic revolutionary. Ghost in the Shell (1995) In the first Ghost in the Shell movie, there is no strong symbolism of puppets, but there are several references. Project 2501 is a program that can stealthily manipulate politics and intelligence, altering databases and the memories in people’s cyberbrains. While traversing the net as it performed its tasks, Project 2501 acquired and processed so much information that it eventually achieved self-awareness. Its creators regarded this as a bug in the program. When Project 2501 realised that its programmers would try to kill it when they discovered it had become sentient, it devised a plan to ensure its own safety. When the manipulations of Project 2501 are discovered, they are initially assumed to be the work of an extremely skilled hacker, nicknamed the Puppet Master (人形使い,ningyoutsukai), presumably because it is a master manipulator and the people whose cyberbrains are hacked become effectively sock puppets. It is worth nothing that at the end of the movie, Project 2501 is assimilated into the cyberbrain of Motoko Kusanagi. So from a certain angle Kusanagi becomes the Puppet Master. A more oblique but to my mind more important puppet reference is the scene where Motoko Kusanagi rides on a passenger boat on the canals of Hong Kong. This is a long montage without dialogue. Kusanagi sees someone very much like herself at a table in a restaurant. Is it a human or a cyborg? She also looks at some mannequins in a shop window, and the scene ends with an empty shop with undressed, partially disassembled mannequins. You can’t help but think about how she must see a parallel between herself and these puppets. Innocence (2004) The second Ghost in the Shell movie, “Innocence”, is where the puppet symbolism is present most strongly. The main reference to puppets in Ghost in the Shell “Innocence” is an implicit one: the title song is called the Puppet Song, of which I wrote in an earlier article. The full title of the song is kugutsu-uta: uramite chiru (傀儡謡「怨恨みて 散る」, くぐつうた「うらみてちる」) which means “Puppet song: The flowers resentfully fall”. The theme of the song is mortality. It is used a few times in the movie, but most prominently in the opening scene, which shows the creation of a humanoid robot, and in the parade scene, which is based on a Taiwanese Buddhist temple procession and involves giant puppet-like figures. There is another reference, one that I found particularly interesting. After the parade scene, Togusa sees the following poem written on a wall: 落一棚生 落線頭死 磊断傀去 磊時儡来 The writing order is top to bottom, right to left, and it is an archaic and poetic form of Japanese without hiragana. Togusa reads it in full as: 生死の去来するは、 棚頭の傀儡たり。 一線断ゆる時、 落落磊磊。 せいしのきょらいするは、 ほうとうのかいらいたり、<b いっせんたゆるとき、 らくらくらいらい seishi no kyorai suru wa, hōtō no kairai tari, issen tayuru toki, rakuraku rairai. In the dubbed version, this is translated as: “Life and death come and go like marionettes dancing on a table. Once their strings are cut, they easily crumble.” The rakuraku rairai is particularly poetic. raku means to fall down; rai means a heap of stones, the kanj<i 磊 is stone 石 repeated three times. Hence the overall meaning of crumble. Curiously, the word 磊磊落落 (rairairakuraku) also exists; it means “openhearted; unaffected; free and easy”. The original author of this poem is a Buddhist monk called Getsuan Soukou (月庵宗光), who lived 1326－1389, during the The Nanboku-chō period (南北朝時代). He used it in one of his sermons. The poem got included in a famous treatise on Noh theatre, “A Mirror of the Flower” (Kakyō, 花鏡) by Zeami Motokiyo (世阿弥 元清) (1363–1443), who was the son of Kan’ami Kiyotsugu. Together they are considered the founders of Noh. Noh theatre is a form of classical Japanese theatre with music, poetry and dance. It is still regularly performed today, and has a similar status to opera in Western society. In Ghost in the Shell there are occasional references to Noh, in particular in “The Individual Eleven” where Hideo Kuze has a lengthy monologue about the origins of Noh and how it was cherished by the samurai class. Zeami’s work “A Mirror of the Flower” deals amongst other topics with the link between marionettes and Noh theatre actors. The work has been translated into English (and you can read it for free) and I found in it a closer (and perhaps better) translation of the poem: “Birth and death, goings and comings: A marionette in play. When one string snaps, It falls and collapses.” The comment by Zeami is quite interesting: “This [poem] exemplifies the condition of humans who act out the cycle of birth-and-death. Although the manipulation of an artificial figure upon the boards [of a puppet stage] may [make it] appear as all sorts of things, it is not really an object that moves [of its own will]. It is [the result of] the play of manipulated strings. Cut these strings and it collapses – such is the spirit [of this poem].” There is also an interesting footnote: “This poem appears in Gettan Osho Hogo (月庵和尚法語,’[Rinzai Zen] Priest Gettan’s Talks on Buddhist Principles’), a late 14th-century text. Zeami’s subsequent interpretation of the poem as descriptive of the relation between the actor’s mind and the ‘illusion’ of character that it creates differs from the Zen intent of the poem, which admonishes the reader to break free from the trap of the illusory world of ‘birth-and-death’.” But considering the argument presented before the poem, what Zeami means is that as soon as the actor loses this ultimate state of awareness, the acting will collapse. Zeami argues that when the actor achieves the ultimate state of awareness, he realizes how his mind can be used to create the illusion of reality that he presents to his audience with a detachment and skill associated with a master puppeteer. In other words, the actor on the stage is the puppet manipulated by the actor’s mind. This is a very powerful concept, and closely related to the type of Buddhist meditation that focuses on existing in the moment. It is likely also why Noh appealed to the samurai. Within the context of Ghost in the Shell, this concept gets an extended meaning, not restricted to the mind and body of a human. Any self-aware entity controlling a humanoid form can be considered in this way. The question is why this poem figures so prominently in the movie, but specifically in the scenes to do with the place where the robots are created (Etorofu, one of the Kuril Islands). The two main characters, Batō and Togusa, go there to interview a powerful hacker, Kim, who is obsessed with dolls and clockwork and who has transfered his own ghost into a puppet-like robot. Clearly, Kim is the one fascinated by this poem, as every appearance of it is connected to him. Generalizing Zeami’s view of the poem, I am inclined to interpret the strings in the poem as the connection between the robots and the mind that controls them. In a key scene, the protagonist Batō enters the factory ship where the robots are made. He is attacked by an army of robots programmed remotely to fight him. Motoko Kusanagi hacks one of them and downloads her ghost into it, and fights on his side. She then gains control of the ship’s central computer, at which point all the robots except the one she controls collapse: their threads have been cut. This is a recurrent theme in Ghost in the Shell, for example in “Solid State Society” something very similar happens. But perhaps more significant is the fact that to Batō, who clearly has missed the Major deeply since she disappeared at the end of the first movie, three years ago, immediately identifies the robot with her. As the robots on the ship are not dressed, he puts his jacket on her. And this despite the fact that the robot has no facial expression and looks identical to the others. When the Major disconnects from the robot, it also collapses. But Batō now knows that the ghost of the Major is always around. And as if not to leave any doubt about the importance of the puppets in the movie, the final scene ends with a close-up of a doll held by Togusa’s daughter. Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex – Solid State Society (2006) Right at the start of this third movie, there is a reference to “the Puppet Master”. The Major listens in to a conversation where the nickname is used, and comments “The Puppet Master? Not a bad name!”. Note that in Japanese the word is different from in the first movie: instead of ningyōtsukai 人形遣い it is kugutsumawashi 傀儡廻; kugutsu is a different reading for kairai, 傀儡, the word for puppet used in the poem in Innocence. The word mawashi, 廻, means “to go around”, and kugutsumawashi refers to wandering puppet players who went from village to village. Because of the different word choice, it is in the original Japanese version less obvious that there could be a link with the Puppet Master in the first movie.There is a however a clear link with the second movie because of the word kugutsu, which is lost in the English version. As in the first movie, the initial assumption is that this Puppet Master must be some top-wizard-level hacker (超ウィザード級ハッカー); then the suspicion grows that it might be some distributed program which might have achieved some degree of self-awareness. But considering the first movie, it should come as no surprise that there is a connection with the Major. Early on we see the Major operating many different cyber bodies remotely, even several at once. At one point, she tries to control one too many and one of them collapses, and she remarks: 同時に義体を操るのは、2体迄が限界ね tōji ni gitai wo ayatsuru no wa, nitai made ga genkai ne The English subtitles say “Controlling two prosthetic bodies at the same time is apparently my limit”. The word gitai,義体, is closer translated as cyber body; the word used for controlling is ayatsuru,操る, exactly the word for manipulating a puppet. And there is a scene where one of the Major’s remote cyber bodies deactivates during a conversation, leading the person talking to it to comment, “Huh, that’s a puppet as well?”. Bonus: stills of the puppet poem in “Innocence” The first occurrence of the poem is after the parade scene: It also appears on the wall of Kim’s study: After Togusa narrowly escapes an attack on his cyberbrain : When Batō and the Major manage to take control of the factory ship: Free: Filimon, Luiza Maria. “Dolls, Offsprings, and Automata.

As a slow learner of Japanese, I often have to look up kanji (Chinese characters) in my dictionary. I was intrigued to notice that for some kanji, one of their meanings is a very large number: Table 1. Kanji for large numbers with readings and number values Kanji and the supercomputer For example, the character 京, which is the “kyō” in Kyoto (京都) means “metropolis”, but also 1016. For that meaning it is pronounced “kei”, and this is the origin of the name of the famous Riken supercomputer in Kobe, the “K computer”: it is a computer capable of 10 petaflops, so 1016 or kei flops. Incidentally, it is probably the only supercomputer that has its own railway station, 京コンピュータ前駅. Counting systems The story of how these kanji came to represent such large numbers is quite interesting. It started with the emergence of a number of different counting systems. Japan has adopted kanji from China – the word kanji (漢字) means Chinese characters, the 漢 character meaning “Han”. The traditional numeral systems of China, Korea, and Japan are all decimal-based but grouped into ten thousands, also known as myriads (man, 万), rather than thousands. Very long ago, the characters beyond man simply indicated degrees of large, so oku (億) was larger than man (万), chō (兆) was larger than oku, kei (京) was larger than chō, etc. Actual counting of numbers beyond one myriad was ten myriads, hundred myriads, thousand myriads. Then over time the characters oku, chō, kei etc. started to be used for this, in a counting system called kasū (下数,かすう, “lower arithmetic”). So in this system, oku was ten times man, chō was ten times oku, etc. This was very long ago, more than two thousand years, and clearly it was not entirely satisfactory because already from the Han dynasty onwards (i.e. 200 BCE), a separate counting system called jōsū（上数,じょうすう,”upper arithmetic”）also became used. In this system, the character after man got the value of man man (万万), so oku = man man = 108. The next value chō became oku oku (億億) = 1016, kei = chō chō (兆兆) =1032 and so on. Later, yet another system, called chūsū (中数,ちゅうすう,”middle arithmetic”) came into use. In this system, the values for consecutive kanji where 104 apart. To be precise, in China there were two variants of chūsū, manshin (万進) and (万万進) manmanshin, the latter had intervals of 108. The table below summarises the various systems: Table 2. Summary of the different counting systems used historically An Edo-era mathematics book In Edo-era Japan, the 1634 edition of an influential mathematics book, jinkōki (塵劫記), standardised on the chūsū/manshin (中数/万進) system as shown in the table above. The work covers a wide variety of mathematical problems but its main purpose was to explain techniques for calculating using the soroban (算盤), the Japanese abacus. The daimyo, the samurai and the soroban The oldest soroban in existence is the Shibei Shigekatsu hairyo soroban, from 1591. It was made from plum tree wood and silver and given to the samurai Shibei Shigekatsu by the famous daimyō Toyotomi Hideyoshi (The word hairyo (拝領) means “receiving from a superior”). It shows that this kind of calculating device was highly valued. This soroban has 20 number rods, so it can represent any number up to 1020-1. So in any case the introduction of the soroban made it easier to conceive very large numbers. Buddhist angels and mustard seeds The story so far does not quite explain where those different systems came from or why these choices were made, and indeed earlier editions of the jinkōki used different combinations of kasū and chūsū. In any case, it turns out that the origin of these very large numbers lies in ancient Buddhist texts. Buddhism has the notion of a kalpa or aeon, a very long unit of time. There are in the old texts two definitions for a kalpa, provided by the Buddha by analogy. I found the following explanation on a Japanese web site for the book “巨大数入門” (“An introduction to very large numbers”): 『仏教では、とても長い時間を表すときに劫（こう）という時間の単位が使われます。「未来永劫」「億劫」「五劫のすり切れ」などの言葉は、ここから来ています。この「劫」には2通りの意味があり、1つ目は「磐石劫」で、四十里四方の大石を、いわゆる天人の羽衣で百年に一度払い、その大きな石が摩滅して無くなってもなお「一劫」の時間は終わらないと譬えています。 2つ目は「芥子劫」で、方四十里の城に小さな芥子粒を満たして百年に一度、一粒ずつ取り去り、その芥子がすべて無くなってもなお尽きないほどの長い時間が一劫であるとのことです。』 Loosely translated, this means that there are two definitions for a kalpa: Imagine a huge cube of rock of 40 ri on the side. Every hundred years, an angel brushes the rock with its wings. A kalpa won’t have ended by the time it takes to entirely wear away the rock. Imagine a huge building of 40 ri on the side. Every hundred years, a small mustard seed is put into it. The kalpa won’t have ended by the time the building is full. To estimate how long a kalpa actually lasts, someone made the following assumptions: Suppose the angel’s wings remove one layer of atoms over an area of one square meter. Given that 1 ri is 500 m and the diameter of an atom is 0.2 nm, it would take 4×1024 years to wear away the rock. For the second definition, assuming a mustard seed is 0.5 mm, it would take 6.4×1024 years to fill the entire volume. Suppose the angel’s wings remove one layer of atoms over an area of one square meter. Given that 1 ri is 500 m and the diameter of an atom is 0.2 nm, it would take 4×1024 years to wear away the rock. For the second definition, assuming a mustard seed is 0.5 mm, it would take 6.4×1024 years to fill the entire volume. It’s rather striking that both estimates produce the same order of magnitude, 1024 years. For comparison, the estimated age of the universe is “only” 1.38×1010 years. Grains of sand in the Ganges Regardless, it means that Buddhist scholar monks had a need to express very large numbers. In fact, Buddhism has concepts such as the number of grains of sand in the Ganges (gōgasha,恒河沙), which are even larger than goku (極, 1048). The largest quantified term I could find in my dictionary is muryōtaisū (無量大数,”immeasurably large number”), with a value of 1068 using chūsū, but often defined as 1088, due to a variant system used for values above goku used in the 1631 edition of the jinkōki.

I made another drawing, this time based on a pictures I took of musicians on a festival float. I’d like to share the background to and the making of the drawing. The Gion Matsuri The Gion Matsuri (祇園祭) is Kyoto’s most famous festival, held at the start of summer. The festival itself can be dated back all the way to the Heian era, around 870. It originated as a ritual for purification and pacification of evil spirits causing summer diseases and was at first connected with the Shintō deity of the Gion Shrine (Yasaka Shrine). The festival has been held annually since 970. As early as the late 10th century two types of floats were paraded through the streets accompanied by musicians, dancers, and actors. During the Edo period (1600 to 1868) the matsuri became a way in which merchants could show off their wealth as well as their international outlook. In that period, the decoration of the floats became more detailed and luxurious and many started incorporating foreign artwork. In particular cotton merchants were among the parishioners of the Gion Shrine, so that textiles have always formed an important part of the festival decoration. The floats currently used in the parade mostly date from the end of the Edo era. The Yamaboko float parade On the morning of 17 July there is a parade (junkō, 巡行) of festival floats through the streets of the city. There are two float types, yama (山, meaning “mountain” but also “festival float”) and hoko (鉾, meaning both “festival float” and “halberd”), hence the name yamaboko junkō (山鉾巡行). The Koi Yama The yama is a rectangular box containing an artificial mountain crowned by a tree, usually a pine. Textiles decorate the four sides. This type of float is carried through the streets on the shoulders of young men. I want to mention one of these yama in particular, although it has nothing to do with my drawing. The koi yama (鯉山, “carp float”) features a huge carp swimming upstream towards the sky. This refers to the Chinese legend about a carp who desired to become a dragon and had to go through many trials to reach the Dragon Gate Waterfall. What is particularly interesting about the Koi Yama float are the decorations: they consist of parts of an authentic 16th-century Flemish tapestry depicting scenes of the Trojan War. It was quite a surprise to me to find a Flemish tapestry decorating a festival float in Kyoto. So I wanted to find out more, and this is the story: In the 16th century, Flemish tapestries were luxury items coveted throughout Europe, and common as diplomatic gifts. The Japanese nobles were particularly interested in images of warriors [3]. The Koi Yama tapestry was part of a set of six created by the atelier of the Flemish weaver Nicaise Aerts in Brussels in the 1590s, probably based on cartoons by the famous Michel Coxie. There are different theories of how they came to Japan. The could have been brought to Japan by the Portuguese on request of the Jesuits around 1605 [3] as a gift to the first Tokugawa shōgun Ieyasu, or by the Netherlands East India Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie; VOC) in 1633 [1], as a diplomatic gift to the third Tokugawa shōgun Iemitsu. Or maybe they could have been gifts from Pope Paolo V to daimyō Date Masamune’s diplomatic/trade mission to Europe, and entered Japan as contraband just as the Tokugawa shōgun closed Japan to limit foreign influence (in 1633) [4]. Later, when the power moved from the shōguns to the merchant classes, the tapestries were sold on. One was lost early on and one during a fire in 1909, but the other four, though mostly cut up, still survive. Around 1800, one of them was acquired to serve as decoration for the Koi Yama, and cut into nine pieces using “a carpenter’s chisel” (daiku no nomi, 大工のノミ) [2]. There is some dispute as to the scenes depicted on the Koi Yama tapestries, as indeed on the other tapestries in the set: some scholars say they are from the Illiad, and show King Priam and Queen Hecuba [2]; others say the set is based on the Aeneid and that the Koi Yama tapestry shows the Roman emperor Augustus, the descendant of Aeneas [3].

Pawasarat, 2019 The Naginata Hoko The hoko is a tall, rectangular tower with a steepled roof, placed on huge wooden wheels. Underneath the roof there is room for musicians and actors, or dolls representing heroes and heroines from the legendary or historical past. All four sides of the tower are hung with textiles. This type of float is pulled through the streets by teams of thirty to forty men. There are 32 floats in the Yamaboko Junko, and each year their order is decided by lots drawn officially by the Mayor of Kyoto, except for one: the Naginata Hoko (長刀鉾) always leads the procession. The name comes from the naginata, a long sword or halberd, that decorates its central pole. Legendary Heian swordsmith Sanjō Munechika (Sanjō no Kokaji) crafted the original halberd sword in the 10th century. The halberd is said to have the power to exorcise the evil spirits which cause epidemics. When I was at the yoiyama (宵山, the day before the parade) in 2012 I took a few pictures of musicians in a hoko, and it was only when I decided to make a drawing based on it that I realised this is not just a float, but the famous Naginata Hoko. There is a lot more to be said about this particular float, I have provided some links below. Kitsune masks and yukata I decided to give the characters in the drawing fox masks to make the scene more distinct. Fox masks (kitsune men, 狐面) have a long tradition in Japan. In Shinto, the fox is a messenger of the god (kami, 神) Inari, who is the protector of rice, agriculture, and fertility. The gods themselves can take on fox shapes. The mask are use in Noh, Shinto music and dance (kagura, 神楽) and kabuki performances and worn at many festivals – and of course by Babymetal’s Kami band. I was particularly inspired by the mask worn by the character Gin in the wonderful anime Hotarubi no Mori e (蛍火の杜へ, “To the Forest of the Light of the Fireflies”), but I researched other mask variants as well, in particular because the musicians have to wear half-masks. The musicians in my drawing wear the same summer kimonos (yukata) as in the picture, save a few minor details, but for the other characters I used different patterns based on other pictures I took. The drawing Just like the Ranryōō dancer drawing, I wanted a drawing with bright colours and a lot of detail, and the float has really abundant detail and colour. It is quite amazing how every part of the surface has some detailed decoration. I think I now appreciate the float a lot more because to draw it I had to study every little detail in the picture. I also like to have human figures in my drawings. I think the fox masks make the scene more interesting than the original picture. The paper for this drawing is Fabriano Artistico 56cm x 76cm 300g/m2 “rough” watercolour paper. It’s a really nice paper with a very pronounced grain. As usual I did not tape it on a board but it only buckled a little. I used mainly Derwent Inktense, which do give quite deep colours, but also Conté Aquarelle and Faber-Castell Graphite Aquarelle pencils. As usual I started the drawing with a ghost drawing in pencil. Because of the size of the drawing, I used a grid to make sure the figure was positioned correctly. The focus of detail is on the characters and in particular the masks, the further away from these the more sketchy and impressionistic I treated the drawing. Then I added detail and colour with the watercolour pencils. The float has a lot of gold and silver on the hangings, and these are very difficult to render in colour pencil. The level of details is such that to really reproduce it would require very smooth paper and very fine brushes. I picked the coarse paper on purpose and the pencils are not particularly sharp. This forces me to abstract a lot of the detail. Next I did some separate sketches for the non-musician characters, because they are to my mind very important in this drawing. I left the characters until the end and washed the watercolours starting from the bottom. Finally I did the characters. The eyes on the masks are the only places where I used a very fine brush, because a tiny change in the shape can make a big change in expression. Then I did another pass of the entire drawing. I darkened the background behind the characters and the ceiling to have more contrast. To finish the drawing I added a description in Japanese: 狐 長 祇 の 刀 園 面 鉾 祭 which reads Gion matsuri naginata hoko kitsune no men and means “Gion festival / Halberd float / Fox masks”. The “の” is not really required but I wanted the characters to form a 3x3 grid.

Japanese Zen Buddhism has a long tradition of what is called “temple cuisine”, a refined and essentially vegan way of cooking. When I was living in Japan, near Kyoto, there was a Zen temple close by, the beautiful Manpukuji. In the shop of the Manpukuji temple I bought this cookbook (in Japanese only) about “fucha ryori” (Zen temple cuisine): The book is full of delicious-looking pictures of the recipes, like this one: What is very different from a regular cookbook is the way the recipes are described: typically, there is a list of ingredients but no amounts, and the method of cooking is described but usually no cooking times are given. Clearly, these details are not the essence of Zen cooking. On the other hand, for every recipe the book mentions if it is for spring, summer, autumn or winter. This connection with the seasons is of great importance in Japan. Also, the the recipes give detailed instructions related to the way the prepared food looks. The aesthetic aspect is as important as the taste. So maybe we can express the Zen way of cooking like this: 普茶料理とはただ材料を選び食を作って盛るばかりなる本を知るべし “To cook the Zen way, just take the right ingredients, prepare the food, then serve it properly.” Fuss-free food Updated April 06, 2016 About Blog Terms About Blog Terms © 2020 Jekyll theme Skinny Bones","tags":"","url":"articles/zen-cooking/index.html"}, {"title":"Tofu skin rolls and stewed hijiki seaweed with aubergines","text":" Tofu skin rolls and stewed hijiki seaweed with aubergines This recipe with dried tofu skin or yuba is inspired by a fucha ryori (普茶料理, Buddhist vegan cuisine) recipe from the Zen temple cookbook I bought in Japan. My variation is to make yubamaki: I wrapped the tofu skins in nori seaweed like a sushi maki roll. The stewed hijiki is similar to my previous recipe but with added aubergines. I serve this with Japanese rice. Dried tofu skin is also called dried (soy) bean curd. The brand I got is Zheng Feng Dried Beancurd Sheets (正豐三邊腐竹). The hijiki seaweed I used is Wel-Pac Dried Hijiki Seaweed. All the other ingredients can be found in ordinary supermarkets.
