So I focus on tasty, healthy meals that are simple and easy to make in a short time. I mostly use ingredients that are easy to find in any supermarket, and most of my recipes take less than 30 minutes to put on the table. My goal with Wim’s Quick and Tasty Food is to write a cookbook and donate the proceeds to the UN World Food Programme. For a publisher to take interest, I need to have many, many followers on Facebook and Twitter. Please help me to achieve this goal by liking my Facebook page or following me on Twitter: I’ve lived in Japan for a short time and I’ve been influenced by the Japanese kitchen, with its emphasis on simplicity, and so I will include some Japanese recipes as well.

All of these are actually very easy. Cooking rice Cooking rice is very easy. The basic rule is: use 2 cups water for 1 cup rice (for Basmati it is only about 1.2 cups for 1 cup rice, for Japanese rice it is 1.1 cup water for 1 cup rice). The cup I use is 200 ml. I wash the rice a few times to get rid of dust and also of the rice flour from polishing. For Japanese rice, you should not just rinse it but also actually “wash” the rice by gently rubbing the grains together between your fingers. A detailed explanation can be found at Makiko Itoh’s site Just Hungry. To cook the 1 cup of rice in the microwave: Put the rice with the water in a microwave-compatible pot with a lid Cook at full power (900W) for one and a half minutes Cook at reduced power (40%, 360W) for 15 minutes. For basmati or Japanese rice this is enough; wholegrain rice takes more time, about 25 minutes. Check if all the water is gone, if not give it another 5 minutes, then check again. To cook the 1 cup of rice on the hob: Put the rice with the water in pot with a lid Bring to the boil Cook over low heat for about 15-20 minutes. For basmati or Japanese rice this is enough; wholegrain rice takes about 25-30 minutes.

Cooking potatoes If you use the microwave, cooking potatoes is again very easy: Wash the potatoes and cut out any eyes or damaged parts, but don’t peel them. You can either cook large potatoes whole or chop them up into small chunks. If you like them whole, pierce them several times with a fork. Put in the microwave at full power for about 10 minutes (for 500g potatoes). Check if they are ready by pricking with a fork or just tasting. If they are not ready, give it another 5 minutes, then check again. Wash the potatoes and cut out any eyes or damaged parts, but don’t peel them.

If they are not ready, give it another 5 minutes, then check again. You can of course cook them on the hob as well but the microwave is a better option, it is quicker and the cooked potatoes taste better too. Cooking pasta Pasta is one of the few foods that I do not cook in the microwave, because you need a large pot with plenty of water. My approach is a bit different from what most other people do, but again very easy: Bring 2 l of water to the boil with a bit of salt (say 1/2 tsp) When the water is boiling heavily, add the pasta (100 g per person) and stir until all the pasta is submerged. Cook for 3 minutes in heavily boiling water, without a lid. Take the pot off the hob, put the lid on and let it stand for the remainder of the time indicated on the package. For example if the cooking time on the package says 12 minutes (quite typical), then leave it for 9 minutes. Strain, sprinkle with some olive oil and serve.

There is no special reason for this other than that I prefer ginger. So let’s make the case for ginger. Many people don’t like onion, raw or cooked. Also peeling and chopping onion is not pleasant, and the smell of onion is hard to wash off your hands. And yet most recipes contain onion. By contrast, few recipes contain fresh ginger. I argue that you don’t need onion to make tasty meals, and that you should consider using fresh ginger instead, and I present the Quick and Tasty recipes as evidence. The main flavours cooked onion adds to a meal are sweetness and umami. But onion is actually not a particularly good source of umami. According to the web site of the Umami Information Center, onion contains about 20-50 mg glutamate/100 g. Ginger contains about 20 mg as well. For reference, tomatoes — a great source of umami — contain almost 250 mg glutamate/100 g. There are many other ingredients that provide umami. Ginger has a unique fresh and very spicy taste, especially in raw form, but it does not burn the mouth like peppers. Raw ginger is great to spice up a salad. Frying reduces the spiciness and enhances the sweetness. The change in taste is the result of applying heat (which transforms gingerol into zingerone) so cooking in the microwave works fine as well, you don’t need to actually fry it. Ginger has many proven health benefits, but the great taste is reason enough to start using it. Here are a few examples of Quick and Tasty recipes with ginger: With raw ginger: Salad: Asparagus and paneer on a bed of rocket and courgettes Soba noodles with soy beans Salad: Asparagus and paneer on a bed of rocket and courgettes Soba noodles with soy beans With cooked ginger: Simple winter hotpot with root vegetables and adzuki beans Potato and vegetable bake with cream cheese Simple winter hotpot with root vegetables and adzuki beans Potato and vegetable bake with cream cheese With fried ginger: Mild root vegetable curry with paneer and rice Iridofu with carrots and shiitake Mild root vegetable curry with paneer and rice Iridofu with carrots and shiitake Most fresh ginger in the UK is imported from China (somewhat surprising as India is the main producer), so you might be concerned about your ginger carbon footprint. I calculated that the contribution of the ginger to my carbon footprint is at most 0.01%. The CO2 footprint of shipping is 10 g per km per 1,000 kg of freight. The distance from China is 19,000 km. My ginger consumption is about 100 g per 2 weeks (7-10 g per meal), so about 2.5 kg per year. The CO2 footprint of shipping is 10 g per km per 1,000 kg of freight. The distance from China is 19,000 km. My ginger consumption is about 100 g per 2 weeks (7-10 g per meal), so about 2.5 kg per year. So we have or about half a kilogram CO2 per year. Using the WWF carbon footprint calculator, I estimate my carbon footprint to be 7-12 tons of CO2 per year. This means that my ginger consumption accounts for no more than 0.5/7,000 or 0.0071% of my yearly carbon footprint.

The study A few days ago a new study was published saying that “Eating more fruits and vegetables may prevent millions of premature deaths”. The media message was that we should eat “10 portions of fruit/veg per day”. But what did the paper really say, and how much is this “10-a-day” anyway? What the study did was looking at a large number (92) of other studies on this topic. The study does not actually mention “10 portions”, instead they looked at fruit and veg intake up to 800g/day. This is twice the official UK recommendation of 400g/day, hence the “10-a-day”. For comparison, the US recommendation is “1.5–2.0 cups of fruit and 2–3 cups of vegetables daily”, and as a cup is 240ml, this is considerably more than 400g/day. I have read the paper and I think this is a reliable study with a sound methodology. The main uncertainty I think comes from the fact that in the individual studies (what they call “cohort studies”), the amounts of fruit and vegetables consumed are self-reported by the participants using food-frequency questionnaires. This has been shown to lead to overestimating the consumption due to “social approval bias” (eating more fruit is good). It is not clear if the cohort studies corrected for this factor; in any case this would not change the observed trends. What about the health benefits? The paper shows that the relative risk of death from coronary heart disease, stroke and cancer is lower for people who eat more fruit and vegetables. As you can see from the figure below (Fig. 6 in the paper), eating 400g/day (“5-a-day”) already leads to a significantly lower risk. To put this into perspective, the relative risk of death from coronary heart disease for men of age 40-44 due to smoking is 6.3. That means that smoking increases your risk by more than 6 times compared to not smoking. By comparison, eating 800g/day instead of 400g/day reduces your relative risk from 0.75 to 0.70 compared to eating no fruits or vegetables at all. The key message of paper is that, assuming there is a causal link, then the percentage of deaths per year due to coronary heart disease, stroke and cancer that could have been avoided by eating 800g fruit/veg a day was 9%, whereas for 500g fruit/veg a day it was 6% (in the UK). So increasing intake from 500g/day to 800g/day would result in 3% fewer deaths, or 14,000 deaths prevented (total number of deaths from these causes was 315,000/year in the UK). The unknown factor is of course if the reduced risk is only because of the diet or if people who eat more fruit and vegetables have lower risks due to other causes as well. Is 800g/day a lot or not? A typical meal contains about 300g vegetables per person. A piece of fruit (say an orange, apple or a banana) typically weighs 100-200g, so two pieces of fruit a day is on average 300g. So eating 600g fruit and vegetables per day is actually very easy to achieve. If your other meals also contain some fruit or vegetables then even 800g/day is really not hard. So don’t be daunted by the “10-a-day’!

I also bought three kitchen tools that I particularly like: ##A flexible, antibacterial cutting mat This mat contains a phytoncide, an antibacterial organic compound derived from plants. To kill all the germs you simply put it in the microwave for a minute. And it can go in the dishwasher as well. You can buy it on line, just search for “phytoncide cutting board”. ##A pair of bamboo cooking chopsticks Long chopsticks are great for cooking pasta or noodles. No risk of burning your fingers and handier than a fork too. You can easily find plain ones but I liked the sakura decoration (cherry blossoms), and it actually has ridges for a better grip. ##A rice scoop Japanese rice is different from other rice in the way it sticks together: when properly cooked, each grain is still quite firm but the grains have a sticky outer layer. That’s why every Japanese kitchen has a rice scoop like this, with little nobs that stop the rice from sticking to it. The scoop can be put upright on its handle, very nifty!

I had always been very interested in Japan, so this was a great opportunity. I started planning a research visit, and at that point I thought it would be better to learn some Japanese. So about three months before the trip I started my first Japanese lesson. Fortunately, nobody told me one should not attempt to learn a new language over the age of forty. And anyone who has learned some Japanese will appreciate how ridiculously short a time three months is; luckily I didn’t know any better. In any case, I started learning very basic Japanese and I loved it: the writing system, the grammar, the culture as expressed through the language. Learning your first kanji (Chinese characters used in Japanese) is a great experience, because kanji are mysterious, beautiful and concise – and you think you can see the logic to it. And learning the first phrases makes you feel it won’t be all that hard. It’s wonderful. Because of the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, I had to postpone my trip. But in the summer of 2012, having learned Japanese for a bit more than a year, I went to Kyoto for a two-month research visit. And it was amazing: kanji everywhere! Somewhere along the path, learning Japanese had become a goal in its own right, not just a practical tool for survival in the wild. It was that as well, of course – just try shopping in a Japanese supermarket without knowing any Japanese. So I conversed in broken Japanese, and looked up kanji on my phone (and was surprised how many signs said “dentist”), and tried to improve my hiragana and katakana reading skills. I didn’t actively study, the total immersion was all I wanted. At that time I had learned only basic grammar and sentence structure, very little informal Japanese – my teacher does not hold with that – and about 100 of the 500 most frequent kanji. I quickly discovered that “most frequent” does not really mean “common” or vice versa. The “most frequent kanji” list is based on newspaper articles, so there are many common kanji that are not in that list. Also, “knowing” or “having learned” a kanji is a rather vague term, and being able to tick them off in a spaced repetition app like Anki or Memrise (great tools though they are!) does not mean you know the meaning of a word consisting of “known” kanji, let alone its pronunciation. Kanji typically have several meanings, sometimes wildly different (e.g. 洗　means both “wash” and “inquire into”) and several readings, some based on the original Chinese pronunciation of the character, some on the Japanese pronunciation of the meaning of the character (e.g. 明日 “tomorrow” can be read as “ashita”, “asu” or “myonichi”). So there is a lot to learn. By now I was hooked, by both the language and the country. Two more years of study later I visited Japan again. On that visit I bought the paperback version of Haruki Murakami’s “1Q84”. It comes in 6 volumes, each about 400 pages. I started reading it on my return (October 2014). It is a slow process because really my Japanese is by far not good enough. I continuously encounter kanji that I have not learned yet or already forgotten, so I have to look them up. Luckily I can do this on my phone, by writing them stroke by stroke. It is now April 2016 and I have reached page 295 (of 357) in the first volume. At this rate, it will take me another 15 years to finish the book. This may not seem very encouraging. However, I hope of course that my reading skills will improve. And in fact I have found reading this way to be more enjoyable than reading the book in English translation: reading Japanese requires a deeper concentration and I feel more immersed in the story – and I find the Japanese writing simply beautiful. The books have also inspired me to make a few “Murakami meals”, which I’ll be posting soon. Speaking of food, I also bought a Zen temple cuisine cookbook, available in Japanese only. It gives a unique insight in the Zen way of cooking – and the language and vocabulary are much easier than Murakami’s. I’d like to thank my teacher Rie Ogura for her patience with me, waiting endlessly while I fumble for the right words.

Haruki Murakami is a bestselling Japanese author. Food is a recurrent theme in his novels. I love the way he lets his characters prepare food, like Nakata in “Kafka on the Shore” peering in the fridge and whipping up a great meal in no time for himself and Hoshino, or Aomame in “1Q84” eating cucumber with mayonaise, or the narrator in “Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World” cooking for the librarian. What I call a “Murakami meal” is a meal made quickly with what you find in the fridge. And although Murakami frequently lets his characters prepare and eat Western-style food, I’ll post recipes for Japanese-style food. Also, of course, my recipes will be vegetarian. My “Murakami meal #1” is aubergines with ponzu, soy beans with shiitake and brown rice with konbu.

There are many, many varieties of rice but in this post I just want to introduce the ones I like and use frequently. Basmati rice, a fragrant, aromatic rice from India, is my staple, mainly because it has such a short cooking time (just 15 minutes). It is very fluffy when cooked right. I have used it in several recipes, for example my favourite Basmati rice with tomatoes and halloumi. The brown rice I use is either Basmati or regular long grain rice. The picture shows Kilombero rice from Malawi. Brown rice has a more earthy taste than white rice and takes longer to cook (about 30 minutes). It it a better source of dietary fiber and vitamines than white rice. Broadly speaking brown rice contains 3x more fiber and vitamins than white rice. It also contains about 3x more magnesium, phosphorus and manganese; for other minerals (calcium, iron, zinc) the difference is smaller. A brown rice meal of 200 g cooked rice will get you about 40% RDA of phosphorus and vitamin B6, 10% RDA of magnesium and vitamin B3. Brown rice goes really well with lentils. Red rice has a nice nutty flavour. I use red rice from the Camargue region in France. This is a recent variety, a result of cross-pollination of cultivated white rice with wild red rice in the 1980s. In terms of cooking time and nutritional value it is similar to brown rice. For an unusual recipe with red rice, check out my aubergine boats with soy beans and red rice. To make risotto you need a rice that can absorb a lot of water without getting sticky. To cook risotto rice you should add the water a little bit at at time, and keep stirring until it has been absorbed, rather than adding it all at once. Through constant stirring, the outer part of the rice grain is ground off by the friction and the starch mixes with the cooking liquid and turns into a creamy sauce that binds the grains together. The typical variety that I use is Arborio. My favourite risotto is the one with oyster mushrooms. For Japanese-style dishes you really need proper Japonica rice: the rice grains cling together without being mushy when cooked properly. It doesn’t necessarily have to come from Japan though. I use either Yumenishiki or Clearspring’s sushi rice, both are grown in Italy. Yumenishiki’s koshihikari is an actual Japanese variety; the Clearspring rice is an Italian Japonica variety, Selenio, which is very similar in taste and properties to Japanese rice. When I was in Japan I used kinuhikari, a local variety from Kyoto. A nice Japanese-style recipe is aubergines, sweet potatoes, tofu and wakame with rice.

The paperback (bunko, 文庫) edition consists of 6 volumes, two volumes for each of the three Books that make up 1Q84. Each volume is about 400 pages. In July 2016 I finished the first volume. It is now May 2019 and I have finally finished the four volumes comprising Books 1 and 2. At first, my reading speed was very slow, about half an hour per page, because I constantly had to look up kanji and grammar constructs. In the last three years, my reading speed has fortunately improved quite a bit: it takes me now five minutes to read a page in Japanese. However, to read the equivalent English translation takes only one minute, so I still have some way to go. As my reading improved, I started to use different ways of reading. Reading aloud In Japanese, “reading aloud” is called rōdoku (ろうどく, 朗読), a word I quite like because rō means “melodious, clear, bright, serene, cheerful”. Maybe somewhat surprisingly, it turns out that silent reading is a relatively young development: before the 17th century, reading essentially meant reading aloud. I find reading aloud very useful because it helps me to understand the flow of the sentence and I also find it easier to understand the meaning. There are many other benefits to reading aloud, as explained in this article on Voices.com. A small disadvantage is that I can get stuck on any kanji for which I don’t know the pronunciation – I find it hard to continue without looking it up right away in my dictionary. Still, I like to read aloud also because I simply like the sound of Japanese. Reading without vocalising When reading Japanese silently (mokudoku もくどく, 黙読), I usually subvocalise, i.e. I hear the text in my head. However, I found that not doing this has some interesting advantages. I am of course not the first one to make this observation, see e.g. Significance of Silent Reading, but these are my observations for the particular case of reading Japanese as a non-native. For one, I don’t get stuck on unknown kanji readings, so my flow is not broken so easily. Also, it means that I go straight from word shapes to meanings. For example, I do not need to know that 菜食主義者 is pronounced saishokushugisha (さいしょくしゅぎしゃ) to know that it means “vegetarian” (菜 sai is vegetable, 食 shoku is to eat, 主義 shugi is doctrine and 者 sha is person). Even for new words it is often possible to tell the meaning from the kanji – one of the advantages of a writing system based on logograms. When not vocalising, it is not necessary to read every individual character. In Japanese the grammar is usually conveyed using groups of hiragana characters and I find that just geting the overall shape is enough to see if a sequence of characters is a negation, or a polite suffix etc. And finally it allows me to speed-read: I can simply scan the text for kanji that indicate the “interesting” parts. And I can now add speed reading to my vocabulary as well: sokudoku (そくどく, 速読). Further reading Here are some articles for your perusal (jukudoku, じゅくどく, 熟読).

Build a core set of recipes To make a quick meal it is important that you don’t have to think about it. By having a set of ten to twenty favourite recipes, you can quickly make what you like and have a wide variety. Use fresh vegetables for taste I think it is really essential to use fresh vegetables in a meal. Vegetables make the meal balanced; fresh vegetables simply taste so much better than the ones in tins or jars. Don’t overcook This may sound totally obvious, but cook the food for the shortest possible time. Many vegetables don’t need to be cooked at all. All you want is that they are hot and maybe slightly softened. They will taste at their best too. Overcooking your food takes longer and destroys the taste. Add umami Umami is a loanword from the Japanese which can be translated as “pleasant savory taste”, and it is one of the five basic tastes. Even after adding spices, nuts, etc., you may find the food is still not “tasty” enough. That means you need to add some umami. Ingredients that contain a lot of umami are dried tomatoes, dried mushrooms, hard cheese, miso, soy sauce, seaweed, garlic, and also beans (in particular fresh soy beans). Think about texture We appreciate food through more than the taste and smell. The way food feels when you eat it — smooth, crunchy, etc. — is equally important. Vegetables are great for texture, this is another reason not to overcook them. For extra crunch you can add seeds or nuts, for more “bite” dried mushrooms are great, for example. Make a one-pot meal Part of the difficulty with cooking is having to multitask with several pots on the hob. Making a one-pot main meal is much simpler and quicker, because you have only one thing to attend to. Use the microwave The microwave oven is much underrated for cooking. It has the advantages of preparing food quickly, preserving more of the nutrients, and it is hassle-free: you don’t have to watch it and there is less cleaning-up afterwards too.

Japanese Zen Buddhism has a long tradition of what is called “temple cuisine”, a refined and essentially vegan way of cooking. When I was living in Japan, near Kyoto, there was a Zen temple close by, the beautiful Manpukuji. In the shop of the Manpukuji temple I bought this cookbook (in Japanese only) about “fucha ryori” (Zen temple cuisine): The book is full of delicious-looking pictures of the recipes, like this one: What is very different from a regular cookbook is the way the recipes are described: typically, there is a list of ingredients but no amounts, and the method of cooking is described but usually no cooking times are given. Clearly, these details are not the essence of Zen cooking. On the other hand, for every recipe the book mentions if it is for spring, summer, autumn or winter. This connection with the seasons is of great importance in Japan. Also, the the recipes give detailed instructions related to the way the prepared food looks. The aesthetic aspect is as important as the taste. So maybe we can express the Zen way of cooking like this: 普茶料理とはただ材料を選び食を作って盛るばかりなる本を知るべし “To cook the Zen way, just take the right ingredients, prepare the food, then serve it properly.” Fuss-free food Updated April 06, 2016 About Blog Terms About Blog Terms © 2019 Jekyll theme Skinny Bones","tags":"","url":"articles/zen-cooking/index.html"}, {"title":"Why the 'Little People' say 'Ho ho'","text":" Why the 'Little People' say 'Ho ho' As mentioned in previous posts, I have been reading Haruki Murakami’s 1Q84 in Japanese (very slowly). After reading some reviews I wrote a blog post on why some of the characters frequently repeat one another, something critics didn’t like. Another thing several critics din’t like is the Little People saying “Ho ho”. So let’s have a look at this “Ho ho”. But first, in case you didn’t read the book, a quick setting of the scene may help. Air Chrysalys In 1Q84, there is a “book in the book” called “Air Chrysalys” (kuukisanagi, 空気さなぎ). This book is a kind of fairytale told from the perspective of a ten-year-old girl who lives in a rural commune. As punishment for letting an old mountain goat die, she gets locked up in a shed with the dead goat for a period of ten days*. One night, the “Little People”** appear from the mouth of the dead goat. This scene starts with one of my favourite descriptions in the Japanese text: あたりが暗くなると、死んだ山羊の目が星明かりを受けてきらりと光った。 atari ga kuraku naru to, shinda yagi no me ga hoshiakari wo ukete kirari to hikatta. In the English translation by Jay Rubin, this reads: When darkness falls, the dead goat’s eye sparkles in the starlight. The Japanese sentence sparkles a bit more because kirari to means “with a momentary flash of light” and hikatta means shine or glitter. Murakami puts the reader nicely on the wrong foot, because when six small figures emerge from the goat’s mouth, the little girl thinks “This is like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but there is one missing”. The “Little People” read her thoughts and when she counts again there are seven of them. Together with the girl they start to make an “air chrysalys” by pulling white threads out of thin air and weaving a kind of cocoon from them. While doing so, they talk to the girl. “Ho ho,” says the keeper of the beat The Little People don’t have names or personalities and indeed it is impossible to keep them apart or even describe them in detail, but they have distinct voices. Usually, each of them speaks a short sentence in turn. There is a recurrent pattern where one of them, in translation called the “keeper of the beat”, says “Ho ho”, and the others chorus “Ho ho”: ｢ほうほう｣はやし役のリトル・ピープルがはやした ｢ほうほう｣残りの六人が声を合わせた “houhou” hayashiyaku no RITORU PIIPURU ga hayashita “houhou” nokori no rokunin ga koe wo awaseta In the Japanese text, the “keeper of the beat” is called hayashiyaku (はやし役) and calls out houhou (ほうほう). This matters because if this “Ho ho” was merely an interjection or exclamation, it would likely be written hoohoo (ほぉほぉ or ほおほお). So we can assume that houhou has a meaning. Japanese has many homonyms and this is no exception. There are several possible ways to write houhou, in hiragana or kanji (Chinese characters), each with a different meaning. According to Kotobank, houhou (ほうほう) means ① 物を投げたりたたいたりする音、またはそのさまを表わす語。ぽんぽん。 “The sound of repeatedly throwing or striking something, or a word to representing it” One of the kanji writings of houhou (ほうほう) is 彭々), which makes the meaning more clear because the character 彭 means “the sound of a drum”. Because Murakami wrote the word in hiragana, we can’t be entirely sure, but the meanings of the other kanji writings (這々 perplexity, 方法 method) do not make much sense in the given context. The link with Noh theatre One of the Little People, who Murakami calls the hayashiyaku, calls out “Ho ho”, and the other six echo this in chorus. The translator of the book, the great Jay Rubin, translates hayashiyaku as “keeper of the beat” to reflect the meaning of houhou as drum beat, and also because Murakami uses the verb hayasu which literally means “to keep time”. So “says the keeper of the beat” is a very nice way to translate this. But the literal meaning in Japanese is “member of a hayashi”, and hayashi (囃子) is the four-piece orchestra in the traditional Noh theatre, consisting of three drummers and a flutist. The task of the drummers is to keep the rhythm (hayasu), but they also use their voices to create drum calls. Another component of Noh is the chorus, usually six to eight people. And finally there are the actors, who unlike in traditional Western theatre do not ony speak their own lines, but can also ‘describe events from the perspective of another character or even a disinterested narrator’. With this interpretation, Murakami allocates to his seven Little People the roles of actors, chorus and orchestra in a Noh performance, all at the same time, with an audience of one, the little girl. I think this is what lies behind the Little People saying “Ho ho”.   * In Japan, traditionally a month is split in three ten-day periods called jun(旬). ** Murakami calls them リトル・ピープル (RITORU PIIPURU) which is katakana rendition of the English “Little People”. The little girl thinks of them as kobito (小人) which also means “little people”.

Going vegan is great but there are some common pitfals if you come from a omnivorous diet. Just cutting out all non-plant-based food might leave you feeling dissatisfied, and craving some of your old food. If your vegan meals are not nutritiously balanced, this will also affect your health. Both are common reasons why people give up on a vegan diet. The good news is that making balanced and tasty vegan meals is quite easy. You could of course just make one of my recipes, but if you want to make your own, here are a few simple guidelines, supported by expert nutritional advice. But let’s first have a look at the fundamentals of a healthy diet. Fundamentals of a healthy diet A healthy diet should provide your body with the following: Proteins, for growth and maintenance. Our bodies do not use the proteins we eat directly, but break them down into amino acids. There are nine essential amino acids which we must obtain from our diet to prevent protein-energy malnutrition. Making sure our meals contain sufficient amounts of these is easy, there are several foods such as beans and pulses that are “complete proteins” which provide all essential amino acids. Vitamins and minerals , nutrients our bodies need in small amounts to work properly and stay healthy. From this angle, there is not much difference between a vegan diet and other diets, with the exception of vitamin B12. As there are no plant-based sources, this needs to be taken as a supplement. Essential fatty acids , needed for many physiological processes, including maintenance of cell membrane structure and skin integrity. There are only two of them, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Again, they are easy to add to your diet: several types of nuts, seeds and vegetable oils are good sources. Carbohydrates, for energy and to aid digestion. Although recently “carbs” got a bad reputation, they are really essential for a healthy diet. There are three main types of carbohydrates: sugar, starch, and fibre. For a healthy diet we need all of them, in the right amounts. The main sources are typical starchy foods like rice, pasta and potatoes. The less refined the food, the better as a source of fibre.

It’s not really neccessary to have all components for every meal though, as long as your diet on the whole provides them. Simple guidelines That may seem like a lot to take in. So how do you make sure you get all these on a daily basis? I use as a very simple rule that my meals should have: A source of protein. Based on the “Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score”, the best sources are tofu, soy beans, chick peas and black beans, but other types of beans or pulses are good too. I use about 100 g per person per meal. A source of starchy carbohydrates, such as rice, pasta and other grain-based foods, or potatoes and similar root vegetables. For rice or pasta I use about 100 g per person per meal, for potatoes about 250g (uncooked weight). A source of fresh vegetables, whatever you like, but as much variety as possible. These provide you with vitamins and some of the minerals, as well as some carbohydrates and protein. I use about 200 g per person per meal (uncooked weight). Some nuts or seeds, like pumkin seeds, sunflower seeds or walnuts. These are great sources of omega fatty acids and minerals. Just a handful is enough. A source of protein.

Why not get started with some of my favourites: Very quick and easy to make: soba noodles with edamame soy beans. Very simple: a stir-fry of carrots, potatoes and chickpeas. A bit more special: a stir-fry of butternut squash, pear and black-eyed beans with brown rice. Very quick and easy to make: soba noodles with edamame soy beans.

Each of the dishes does not take long to prepare (15-20 minutes) but requires some soaking time. Two of the dishes use kombu dashi, this is very easy to make but requires some forward planning: put a piece of kombu of about 10 x 10 cm into about 500 ml water and put it in the fridge overnight.  Japanese-style  vegan  gluten-free  45-minutes  • 825 kcal per person   I have written out the recipese for each dish separately, in the order in which I prepared them. The hijiki and shiitake need to be soaked for one hour, and the rice needs an hour in total before cooking as well. After this hour soaking time you can just prepare them in order, or if you want it to be a little bit quicker, you can start the rice and the iridofu when you’ve set the hijiki to simmer. This is another very typical Japanese dish called hourenso no ohitashi (ほうれん草のお浸し), you can find the original recipe at Just One Cookbook and a very quick and easy variant at Just Bento. It is and very easy to make if you have the dashi ready. The preparation time is about 5 minutes but it has to marinate for at least 30 minutes after that so it is not actually quick. For two people: Main ingredients: 1 pack of spinach (200 g) Seasonings half a cup cup dashi 1 tablespoon mirin 1 tablespoon soy sauce Main ingredients: 1 pack of spinach (200 g) Main ingredients: 1 pack of spinach (200 g) 1 pack of spinach (200 g) Seasonings half a cup cup dashi 1 tablespoon mirin 1 tablespoon soy sauce Seasonings half a cup cup dashi 1 tablespoon mirin 1 tablespoon soy sauce half a cup cup dashi 1 tablespoon mirin 1 tablespoon soy sauce Mix the dashi, mirin and soy sauce. Put the spinach in the microwave for 1 minute or at most 90 seconds, so that it is just fully wilted. Rinse under cold water to cool. Then squeeze the juice out of the spinach with your hands and create “logs” of about 10 cm long and 3-4 cm wide. Cut the “logs” into pieces of 2-3 cm and put them in a shallow bowl. Pour over the dashi mixture and let marinate for at least half an hour. Mix the dashi, mirin and soy sauce.

This way to prepare hijiki seaweed is a very common in Japan, and you can find the original recipe for example at Just Bento or at Just One Cookbook. My variation is to add some ginger and use vegan kombudashi rather than the katsuodashi common in Japan. For two people: Main ingredients: 3-4 tablespoons hijiki seaweed 1 large carrot or 2 small ones 2-3 thin slices from a block of hard tofu, about 50 g (more if you want it to be more filling) Other ingredients: 1 cm ginger, sliced thinly 1 cup kombudashi enough kaeshi for 1 cup dashi: 2 tablespoons mirin 1 tablespoon sugar 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 teaspoon sesame oil 1 tablespoon olive oil (any other oil for frying is fine) Main ingredients: 3-4 tablespoons hijiki seaweed 1 large carrot or 2 small ones 2-3 thin slices from a block of hard tofu, about 50 g (more if you want it to be more filling) Main ingredients: 3-4 tablespoons hijiki seaweed 1 large carrot or 2 small ones 2-3 thin slices from a block of hard tofu, about 50 g (more if you want it to be more filling) 3-4 tablespoons hijiki seaweed 1 large carrot or 2 small ones 2-3 thin slices from a block of hard tofu, about 50 g (more if you want it to be more filling) Other ingredients: 1 cm ginger, sliced thinly 1 cup kombudashi enough kaeshi for 1 cup dashi: 2 tablespoons mirin 1 tablespoon sugar 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 teaspoon sesame oil 1 tablespoon olive oil (any other oil for frying is fine) Other ingredients: 1 cm ginger, sliced thinly 1 cup kombudashi enough kaeshi for 1 cup dashi: 2 tablespoons mirin 1 tablespoon sugar 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 teaspoon sesame oil 1 tablespoon olive oil (any other oil for frying is fine) 1 cm ginger, sliced thinly 1 cup kombudashi enough kaeshi for 1 cup dashi: 2 tablespoons mirin 1 tablespoon sugar 2 tablespoons soy sauce 2 tablespoons mirin 1 tablespoon sugar 2 tablespoons soy sauce 2 tablespoons mirin 1 tablespoon sugar 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 teaspoon sesame oil 1 tablespoon olive oil (any other oil for frying is fine) Soak the hijiki for at least an hour in cold water. While the hijiki is soaking: Cut the tofu into thin strips and put it in the microwave for 2 minutes at full power (900W). Cut the carrots in small strips. Heat the olive oil and sesame oil. Fry the tofu, carrots and ginger until the tofu just starts to brown. Add the soaked hijiki and fry some more.

The final and most substantial dish in this meal is iridoufu (炒り豆腐), another very common dish. It is quite easy and quick to make, in about 15 minutes. The original recipe is from Just Bento. For two people: Main ingredients: 1 block of firm tofu 200-250 g a bunch of chives (abour half a cup chopped) 4 dried shiitake mushrooms, soaked in hot water for at least an hour. You will need 4 tablespoons of the soaking liquid as well.

Heat the oil and fry the ginger and the sesame seeds, then add the chives and mushrooms and fry over medium heat for 30 seconds. Add the tofu to the pan, crumble it with your hands or with a spatula. Fry for a few minutes over low heat, then lower the heat and let simmer. Meanwhile, mix 4 tablespoons of the shiitake soaking liquid with the miso and the soy sauce (optional as it mainly makes the dish a bit more salty).

For two people: 1 cup of Japanese rice 1 cup of Japanese rice Use 1.1 cup water for 1 cup rice. The cup I use is 200 ml. I wash the rice a few times to get rid of dust and also of the rice flour from polishing. For Japanese rice, you should not just rinse it but also actually “wash” the rice by gently rubbing the grains together between your fingers. A detailed explanation can be found at Makiko Itoh’s site Just Hungry.

The focus of this post is on how I’m learning and what tools I’ve been using. I think that the most important factor in learning Japanese is not to give up, to keep working at it steadily, even if it’s only a few minutes every day. This is probably true for learning any language, but I think more so for Japanese because of the need to learn kanji. When I started (in 2011), I used JapanesePod101, and I really think that for absolute beginners it is a very good way to start. I listened to the podcasts on my way to work and found that quite effective. The audio lessons also come with written material covering vocabulary and grammar and the JapanesePod101 YouTube channel has a very large collection of videos. Apart from that I also used Tae Kim’s Guide to Learning Japanese, especially the grammar guide. I learned this way for about a year, but then I decided I wanted to focus more on reading and less on listening, so I started learning kanji. (To practise conversation I get a two-hour lesson with a Japanese teacher every two weeks.) I try to do at least 5 minutes of kanji practice per day. That really isn’t much, and yet it was sufficient to learn the 2,000 common use (Jouyou,常用) kanji in about four years. As I wrote in my earlier post, by summer 2012 I only knew about 100 kanji, and I finished the Jouyou series before the start of last summer. I still do my daily kanji practice because unless I revise I easily forget them. I have an Android phone, and initially I used Anki, then Simple Kanji Quiz, but I felt that I made most progress when I started using Memrise. I still use Simple Kanji Quiz because it is very configurable but what I like about Memrise is its goalsetting. It’s quite rewarding to reach your daily goal after five minutes! I looked at WaniKani as well because I love Tofugu, but WaniKani only works if you start from scratch so by the time it came out I had already learned most of the basic kanji. I have thought quite a lot about the best ways to learn but in the end I’ve decided not to be very systematic. For example, my Memrise deck only tests if I know the meaning of a kanji, not its on and kun readings. I have set up my Simple Kanji Quiz to practise readings both ways. So for a given kanji I’m either practising meaning or reading but not both at the same time. My only kanji handwriting practice is looking up kanji on my phone (I use Kanji Draw but the Japanese app is also very good). Handwriting kanji on paper takes a lot of time, and unless you live in Japan I don’t think it is an essential skill. To expand my vocabulary my main approach is reading. I also sometimes listen to podcasts or Japanese music, or watch anime or Japanese movies, and of course I should learn new words while talking to my teacher. But I don’t really spend time in memorising new words, I just let it happen. I found that encountering words in different contexts is a great way to learn. For example, a few days ago I read the word でかい (huge) in a blog post, and then I heard it used in the anime Spirited Away. Now I’m pretty sure I will remember this word.　 But what really works best for me to build vocabulary is to go to Japan, so of course I would strongly recommend that. The constant immersion works wonders. Many words I remember because I see in my mind the situation where I first encountered them.　 Fuss-free food Updated December 22, 2017 About Blog Terms About Blog Terms © 2019 Jekyll theme Skinny Bones","tags":"","url":"more-on-articles/learning-japanese/index.html"}, {"title":"Drawing the dancer of Ranryōō","text":" Drawing the dancer of Ranryōō Some years ago I was at the yoiyama (宵山) – or maybe the yoiyoiyama (宵々山), or even the yoiyoiyoiyama (宵々々山) – in any case, the eve of the Gion Matsuri (祇園祭), Kyoto’s most famous festival. I came across a traditional dance performance and took some pictures, one of them is the banner for this post. This summer I wanted to make a drawing with a Japanese theme and I selected that picture. Before starting on the drawing, I felt I had to find out more about the dance. Most of what follows is taken from the page about Ryōō 陵王 on the Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System and the Japanese Wikipedia page about Ranryōō (蘭陵王), with some additional information from this New York Public Library blog article. The legend The most common interpretation of the dance is that it celebrates the victory of Prince Lanling (Ranryōō, 蘭陵王) of Pohai (北斉 , Manchuria) over the Zhou dynasty, around 550 A.D. He was a general named Gao Changgong who was given a fiefdom in Lanling, so he was also known as the Prince of Lanling. The Prince of Lan Ling was one of the four most handsome men in ancient Chinese history. A masterful warrior, he led his army into battle and vanquished his foes while wearing a fearsome Ryōō mask to hide his beauty. His most famous battle was the breaking of the siege of Jinyong (金墉, near modern Luoyang) in 564 A.D. Gao Changgong led only 500 cavalrymen and fought through an army of Northern Zhou, which was attacking the city with 100,000 soldiers. He fought his way to the gates the city, surprising the defenders. The soldiers of Jinyong didn’t recognize him, so he took off his helmet and mask. The soldiers in the city rejoiced at his arrival and their courage returned. They opened the gates and joined the battle outside the city. Soon the army of Northern Zhou was defeated. To celebrate the victory, the soldiers composed the famous song and dance “Prince Lanling in Battle” (兰陵王入阵曲). The tradition There are variations on the legend: some say that the prince wore the mask himself to frighten his enemies, others that his father’s ghost appeared wearing the mask. Others trace the dance back to the Eight Dragon Kings (hachidai ryuuou 八大竜王) of the Buddhist Lotus Sutra. Following this latter tradition, folk festivals in Japan since the 13th century often incorporate the dance of Ran-ryou-ou as a rain prayer, as dragons are associated with water. This may partly account for the great popularity of the dance. The dance The dance is called ranryouou nyuujinkyoku (蘭陵王入陣曲) “The song of Prince Lan-Ling going into Battle”. It is a traditional Japanese court dance or bugaku (舞楽) introduced in the Japanese Imperial courts in the 9th century, and performed to traditional Japanese court music or gagaku (雅楽). For much of its history, bugaku was an exclusive and privileged experience, performed only at the Japanese imperial court and, very rarely, as part of religious rituals at temples or shrines. In those days (the Heian era) the imperial court was organized with a strict Left and Right division. In terms of culture, poetry, music and dance, the Left was associated with China or India and the Right with Korea. Costumes for dances of the Left are primarily red. The music, tougaku (唐楽) is a Japanese adaptation of Chinese musical styles prevalent during the T’ang Dynasty. The Ranryōō is a dynamic dance of the Left (sa-no-mai 左舞) and it is originally from either China or Southeast Asia (rin’yuugaku 林邑楽). It is performed by one person dressed in a fringed tunic and pantaloons (ryoutou shouzoku 裲襠装束). The mask or bugakumen (舞楽面) is of a fierce, mythical golden beast with a dragon perched on its head. The mask Although Ranryōō masks can look vary different, they all share a common set of features: a sharp, long nose; bulging, rotating eyes (dougan 動眼); a gaping mouth with huge teeth and dangling chin (tsuriago 吊顎); wrinkles that line the face and the carved strands of heavy hair above the forehead. The golden face and metallic eyes are offset by the blue-green hair and vermilion mouth. There are tufts of animal hair suggestive of eyebrows, a moustache and beard. On the top of the head perches a crouching dragon. I found an interesting blog post (in Japanese) by a Ranryōō dancer, where he compares various masks from his own collection. The drawing I wanted to make a drawing with bright colours and a lot of detail, and also I prefer to draw human figures, but I didn’t want to do a portrait. So this Ranryōō dancer was a perfect match. I replaced the audience with people in yukata (浴衣, a light summer kimono) to make the scene more homogeneous. For most of the yukata designs I used my own pictures but the designs of the central four figures are based on the yukata worn by the sisters in Hirokazu Kore-eda’s wonderful movie “海街 diary” (“Our little sister”). The main focus is of course the dancer, so I drew and coloured the musicians and audience in a much more sketchy way. The paper for this drawing is Arches 56cm x 76cm 300g/m2 “rough” watercolour paper. It’s a really nice paper with a pronounced grain and absorbs the water really well. As I did not tape it on a board, the sheet of course buckled a bit. I used Derwent Inktense and Conté Aquaralle pencils as well as watercolour paint (various brands). The Inktense pencils give a very saturated colour. It was the first time I used them but I really like them. I started the drawing as usual with a pencil ghost drawing. Because of the size of the drawing, I used a grid to make sure the figure was positioned correctly. Then I added a first layer of detail and colour with the watercolour pencils. Next I started to detail and wash the mask. I needed a very fine pencil and a magnifying glass for the eyes. Then I worked on the tunic in the same way. Next I did the trousers, which took a long time, and the sleeves, ending the first full pass of the entire figure. Then I worked on the detail of the yukata of the figures in the background, which I decided to do in indigo blue for all of them. Usually I use a relatively blunt pencil because in general that works better on coarse-grained paper, but to render the patterns on the fabric with very fine lines before washing them I used an extra-sharp pencil. Next I added more detail and colour to the musicians, but I left them quite sketchy on purpose. Then I put a second layer of colour on the dancer, to make the red and orange more vibrant, and make the shadows more pronounced. I used a mixture of watercolour paint and watercolour pencils. Finally I did another pass of the entire drawing. I added more colour to the background figures but made them darker at the same time, as they are actually in the shadow. Adding the shadow layer was tricky because I could not just wash the entire background with a darker tint, as it would make the colours run. Instead, I used a layer of colour pencil. I added still more colour to the dancer, especially to the sleeves, again using a mixture of watercolour paint and watercolour pencils.

I read the English translation when it was first published but I had never looked up any reviews. The Japanese paperback comes in six volumes and after finishing the third volume*, I decided to check some reviews, and I was somewhat surprised to find that most critics didn’t like the book very much. One of the recurrent criticisms is that the characters repeat one another frequently. This is in particular the case for the conversations between Tengo and Fuka-eri. Murakami mentions that Fuka-eri has dyslexia and based on her behaviour and speech it is likely that she also has autistic spectrum disorder (Murakami describes her speech as monotonous or flat, and she clearly prefers to use single words, although she can speak in full sentences; her facial expression is impossible to read; there are many more hints like this). In Japanese, Murakami uses a specific writing style to express Fuka-eri’s way of speaking. Japanese has three sets of characters: hiragana and katakana which are phonetic alphabets, and Chinese characters (kanji). In general, kanji are used to indicate the meaning of words, hiragana is used to express the grammar and katakana is used for foreign words or as a kind of italics. Japanese has few distinct sounds, there are lots of homonyms, and the kanji disambiguate the meanings for the homonyms. However, katakana and hiragana can be used to phonetically write kanji but sentences without kanji can be difficult to read, especially because no spaces are used between words. Murakami renders Fuka-eri’s speech using hiragana and katakana characters only, without kanji. For example: 「セキブンのはなしはおもしろかった」 「予備校の僕の講義のこと？」 ふかえりは肯いた。 「君は数学は好き？」 ふかえりは短く首を振った。数学は好ではない。 「でも積分の話は面白かったんだ？」と天語は尋ねた。 In the English translation by Jay Rubin, the exchange is: ‘The calculus part was good.’ ‘You mean in my lecture?’ Fuka-eri nodded. ‘Do you like math?’ She gave her head a quick shake. She did not like math. ‘But the part about calculus was good? he asked.’ Even though the translator has changed the wording slightly, the last sentence still mostly repeats the first. When written in roman alphabet, the first and the last sentence of the Japanese dialogue are virtually identical: ‘sekibun no hanashi wa omoshirokatta’ ‘demo sekibun no hanashi wa omoshirokatta?’ However, although the pronunciation is word for word identical, the effect in the original Japanese text is different because the first sentence, said by Fuka-eri, is written only in hiragana and katakana characters, while the last sentence, said by Tengo, uses kanji. For example, while sekibun has only one meaning, the seki in sekibun could mean amongst others “stone” or “seat” or “red”; bun could mean amongst others　”minute”, “sentence” or “mosquito”. Without the kanji it is harder for the reader, and requires more context, to work out the meaning. Furthermore, Japanese has the particular grammar feature of particles (joshi, 助詞). These are suffixes or short words that immediately follow a noun, verb, adjective, or sentence and can act as conjunctions, prepostions or modifiers. Some of these particles are attached at the very end of the sentence to add an emotion or tone, or convey that the sentence is a question. Fuka-eri never uses those sentence-ending particles, and in particular the question marking particle. As her speech is uninflected, and the word order in Japanese is the same for statements and questions, it is not always clear if she is asking a question or just stating something. For example: 「わたしをだきたくない」とふかえりは疑問符抜きで尋ねた。 ‘watashi wo dakitakunai’ to fukaeri wa gimonfunuki de tazuneta. Which Jay Rubin translates as: ‘You don’t want to hold me,’ Fuka-eri asked without a question mark. Because of the lack of question mark or particle, there is no way to know if this is a question or not. A proper Japanese sentence would have been either「私を抱きたくないか」or 「私を抱きたくない？」and indeed, Tengo says: 「君を抱く？」 ‘Hold you?’ The lack of kanji and particles means that Fuka-eri’s sentences in Japanese are often quite ambiguous. So when Tengo repeats Fuka-eri’s sentences, he’s making sure that he understands her correctly, but Murakami also uses this to clarify to the reader what she’s just said. For example, 「イヘンがあろうとしている」 「イヘン」と天吾は言った。それが「異変」であると思い当たるまでに少し時間がかかった。 ‘ihen ga arou toshite iru’ ‘ihen’ to tengo wa itta. sore ga ‘ihen’ de aru to omoiataru made ni sukoshi jikan ga kakatta. The meaning of “ihen” (イヘン) is not clear when written in katakana. In fact, a possible meaning of the sentence could be ‘You’ll have a leather cord’. The Japanese sentence actually says that it takes a while for Tengo to realise that “ihen”,イヘン means ”something unusual”,異変. In the English translation, this becomes ‘That something extra ordinary is starting.’ It took Tengo a moment to realize this meant “extraordinary”. Jay Rubin has left out the sentence ‘ihen’ to tengo wa itta. He could have translated it as ‘Extra ordinary’ said Tengo, but that would have made the exchange even more repetitive. In the Japanese version of 1Q84, the exchanges with Fuka-eri are my favourite parts. Her sentences are very easy to read, except for the lack of kanji; then Tengo’s paraphrasing puts in the kanji as well. So as a learner I get both the reading and the meaning. Another example: 「わたしはここにのこっている」とふかえりは言った。 「君はここに残っている」と天語は反復した。 ‘watashi wa koko ni nokotte iru’ to fukaeri wa itta. ‘kimi wa koko ni nokotte iru’ to tengo wa hanpuku shita. The translation says: ‘I’ll stay here,’ Fuka-eri said. ‘You’ll stay here,’ Tengo echoed her. Again, this looks more repetitive than the original. The English translation of the first two books is by Jay Rubin, who is very renowned for translating Murakami’s works, and I think his translation of 1Q84 is excellent. However, the repetition in the English translation is fundamentally different from the Japanese original because of the writing system. It is impossible to translate the effect of the difference between words writtin in hiragana, katakana and kanji into a language with a single alphabet-based writing system like English.     *After four years of reading.

(It’s now July 2016 and I’ve finally finished the first volume!) This post is about reading Japanese. I’ll give some tips on how to look up kanji and a few handy rules to simplify the reading process. I haven’t really encountered these tips and rules as such in my learning materials, so I thought they may be of interest to other learners as well. When learning to read in a language that uses an alphabet, you can simply look up any word you don’t know in a dictionary. Because of the use of kanji (漢字, Chinese characters), things are more complicated for the learner of Japanese. Words written in katakana or hiragana (the sets of about fifty characters used to write Japanese phonetically) are easy to look it up. But what to do with kanji? There are about two thousand kanji in general use. Learning them all takes a long time: in the Japanese school system, it takes nine years. Typically each kanji has several possible readings (pronunciation) and meanings. And knowing every meaning of every kanji does not mean knowing the meaning of words that use combinations of kanji. For me, reading for learning is different from ordinary reading. Normally, I read to understand the meaning of a text. When learning Japanese, I also want to learn the readings of the kanji I encounter and I want to practise recall of the kanji and compound words that I’ve already learnt. Usually I make a first pass through a page of the text without looking anything up, trying to remember as much as possible, both readings and meanings, and to guess at readings and meanings of compound words where possible. Very often the context helps to guess at meanings, so I make sure to read enough text to get sufficient context. Then in a second pass I look up every kanji for which I don’t know either the reading or the meaning, and every compound word that I don’t know. I find that the most convenient way to look up a kanji is an electronic dictionary on a smartphone, because I need to know just one of the readings. If I don’t know any of the readings, I use three different ways, depending on the kanji. All of them require understanding of the basics of kanji writing and structure: the stroke order, stroke count and the “radicals”, the kanji building blocks that make up the more complex kanji. The first way is to draw the kanji stroke by stroke. I prefer this approach as a learner, because I tend to remember the kanji better if I’ve had to write it. Typically, a kanji writing app will present a list of kanji that match the handwritten one. If my writing was good, I’ll get the kanji I was looking for on the first page. The second approach is to look up the kanji by radical. Most electronic dictionaries offer that facility. It usually works well if the radicals making up the kanji are clear. It really helps to know how to count the strokes in a radical, because they are usually ordered by stroke count. My final way is to use a (paper) dictionary with the SKIP (System of Kanji Indexing by Patterns) system for ordering kanji. I have the well-known “Kodansha Kanji Learner’s Dictionary”. The SKIP method is based on first classifying the kanji into one of 4 groups (Left-Right ◧, Up-Down ⬒, Enclosure ◻, and Solid ◼). For the first two categories, further indexing is by stroke count of both parts. Kanji in the third category (enclosure) are indexed by the number of sides of the enclosure. Kanji in the last category typically can’t always be broken down, but there aren’t that many of them and most of them are simple kanji. The first way is to draw the kanji stroke by stroke.

Kanji in the last category typically can’t always be broken down, but there aren’t that many of them and most of them are simple kanji. Although the many readings and meanings may sound horribly complicated, I found that there are actually a few general rules that simplify the reading process. Of course there are exceptions to all of these rules but they hold most of the time. Kanji have typically two types of readings, called on (音,”sound”) and kun (訓,”instruction” or “explanation”). The on-reading is based on the sound of the original Chinese reading of a character; the kun-reading is the Japanese word with the same meaning. Chinese used to play a similar role as Latin or Greek in ancient Japan, so in a way on-readings are comparable with words with a Latin or Greek root in English. The first general rule is that kanji appearing on their own (i.e. not in combination with other kanji) have almost always the kun-reading. For example, for the kanji 食, it will be one of the four kun-readings (く.う “ku-u”, く.らう “ku-rau”, た.べる “ta-beru” or は.む “ha-mu”), not one of the on-readings. To select the correct kun-reading, look at the hiragana following the kanji so 食う is pronounced as “kuu” and 食べる is pronounced as “taberu”. The second general rule is that in a compound word, all kanji have either the on- or the kun-reading. And for the vast majority of the compound words, it will be the on-reading. For example, 食事 is shokuji (on-_on_), not “ta-ji” (kun-_on_) or “shoku-koto” (on-_kun_). Generally, there are fewer on-readings than kun-readings for a kanji, and on-readings are also mostly single-syllable. Although there are indeed many on- and kun-readings, for most kanji one of each will be the most frequently used, and the others will likely be used only in fixed combinations. The same is true for meanings: usually one of the meanings is used much more frequently than all the others.

Even if reading a Japanese text may seem daunting at first, it is a very rewarding experience, and it is actually less complicated than it seems. I hope these tips and rules will help you to read Japanese more easily.

As a slow learner of Japanese, I often have to look up kanji (Chinese characters) in my dictionary. I was intrigued to notice that for some kanji, one of their meanings is a very large number: Table 1. Kanji for large numbers with readings and number values Kanji and the supercomputer For example, the character 京, which is the “kyō” in Kyoto (京都) means “metropolis”, but also 1016. For that meaning it is pronounced “kei”, and this is the origin of the name of the famous Riken supercomputer in Kobe, the “K computer”: it is a computer capable of 10 petaflops, so 1016 or kei flops. Incidentally, it is probably the only supercomputer that has its own railway station, 京コンピュータ前駅. Counting systems The story of how these kanji came to represent such large numbers is quite interesting. It started with the emergence of a number of different counting systems. Japan has adopted kanji from China – the word kanji (漢字) means Chinese characters, the 漢 character meaning “Han”. The traditional numeral systems of China, Korea, and Japan are all decimal-based but grouped into ten thousands, also known as myriads (man, 万), rather than thousands. Very long ago, the characters beyond man simply indicated degrees of large, so oku (億) was larger than man (万), chō (兆) was larger than oku, kei (京) was larger than chō, etc. Actual counting of numbers beyond one myriad was ten myriads, hundred myriads, thousand myriads. Then over time the characters oku, chō, kei etc. started to be used for this, in a counting system called kasū (下数,かすう, “lower arithmetic”). So in this system, oku was ten times man, chō was ten times oku, etc. This was very long ago, more than two thousand years, and clearly it was not entirely satisfactory because already from the Han dynasty onwards (i.e. 200 BCE), a separate counting system called jōsū（上数,じょうすう,”upper arithmetic”）also became used. In this system, the character after man got the value of man man (万万), so oku = man man = 108. The next value chō became oku oku (億億) = 1016, kei = chō chō (兆兆) =1032 and so on. Later, yet another system, called chūsū (中数,ちゅうすう,”middle arithmetic”) came into use. In this system, the values for consecutive kanji where 104 apart. To be precise, in China there were two variants of chūsū, manshin (万進) and (万万進) manmanshin, the latter had intervals of 108. The table below summarises the various systems: Table 2. Summary of the different counting systems used historically An Edo-era mathematics book In Edo-era Japan, the 1634 edition of an influential mathematics book, jinkōki (塵劫記), standardised on the chūsū/manshin (中数/万進) system as shown in the table above. The work covers a wide variety of mathematical problems but its main purpose was to explain techniques for calculating using the soroban (算盤), the Japanese abacus. The daimyo, the samurai and the soroban The oldest soroban in existence is the Shibei Shigekatsu hairyo soroban, from 1591. It was made from plum tree wood and silver and given to the samurai Shibei Shigekatsu by the famous daimyō Toyotomi Hideyoshi (The word hairyo (拝領) means “receiving from a superior”). It shows that this kind of calculating device was highly valued. This soroban has 20 number rods, so it can represent any number up to 1020-1. So in any case the introduction of the soroban made it easier to conceive very large numbers. Buddhist angels and mustard seeds The story so far does not quite explain where those different systems came from or why these choices were made, and indeed earlier editions of the jinkōki used different combinations of kasū and chūsū. In any case, it turns out that the origin of these very large numbers lies in ancient Buddhist texts. Buddhism has the notion of a kalpa or aeon, a very long unit of time. There are in the old texts two definitions for a kalpa, provided by the Buddha by analogy. I found the following explanation on a Japanese web site for the book “巨大数入門” (“An introduction to very large numbers”): 『仏教では、とても長い時間を表すときに劫（こう）という時間の単位が使われます。「未来永劫」「億劫」「五劫のすり切れ」などの言葉は、ここから来ています。この「劫」には2通りの意味があり、1つ目は「磐石劫」で、四十里四方の大石を、いわゆる天人の羽衣で百年に一度払い、その大きな石が摩滅して無くなってもなお「一劫」の時間は終わらないと譬えています。 2つ目は「芥子劫」で、方四十里の城に小さな芥子粒を満たして百年に一度、一粒ずつ取り去り、その芥子がすべて無くなってもなお尽きないほどの長い時間が一劫であるとのことです。』 Loosely translated, this means that there are two definitions for a kalpa: Imagine a huge cube of rock of 40 ri on the side. Every hundred years, an angel brushes the rock with its wings. A kalpa won’t have ended by the time it takes to entirely wear away the rock. Imagine a huge building of 40 ri on the side. Every hundred years, a small mustard seed is put into it. The kalpa won’t have ended by the time the building is full. To estimate how long a kalpa actually lasts, someone made the following assumptions: Suppose the angel’s wings remove one layer of atoms over an area of one square meter. Given that 1 ri is 500 m and the diameter of an atom is 0.2 nm, it would take 4×1024 years to wear away the rock. For the second definition, assuming a mustard seed is 0.5 mm, it would take 6.4×1024 years to fill the entire volume. Suppose the angel’s wings remove one layer of atoms over an area of one square meter. Given that 1 ri is 500 m and the diameter of an atom is 0.2 nm, it would take 4×1024 years to wear away the rock. For the second definition, assuming a mustard seed is 0.5 mm, it would take 6.4×1024 years to fill the entire volume. It’s rather striking that both estimates produce the same order of magnitude, 1024 years. For comparison, the estimated age of the universe is “only” 1.38×1010 years. Grains of sand in the Ganges Regardless, it means that Buddhist scholar monks had a need to express very large numbers. In fact, Buddhism has concepts such as the number of grains of sand in the Ganges (gōgasha,恒河沙), which are even larger than goku (極, 1048). The largest quantified term I could find in my dictionary is muryōtaisū (無量大数,”immeasurably large number”), with a value of 1068 using chūsū, but often defined as 1088, due to a variant system used for values above goku used in the 1631 edition of the jinkōki.
