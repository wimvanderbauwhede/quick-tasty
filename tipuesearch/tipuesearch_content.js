I like to cook but I don’t have much time as I have a full-time job. So I focus on tasty, healthy meals that are simple and easy to make in a short time. I mostly use ingredients that are easy to find in any supermarket, and most of my recipes take less than 30 minutes to put on the table. My goal with Wim’s Quick and Tasty Food is to write a cookbook and donate the proceeds to the UN World Food Programme. For a publisher to take interest, I need to have many, many followers on Facebook and Twitter. Please help me to achieve this goal by liking my Facebook page or following me on Twitter: I’ve lived in Japan for a short time and I’ve been influenced by the Japanese kitchen, with its emphasis on simplicity, and so I will include some Japanese recipes as well.

Blog Blog Blog The Basics If you don’t have much experience cooking, then it helps to know the basics: how to cook rice, potatoes and pasta. All of these are actually very easy. Cooking rice Cooking rice is very easy. The basic rule is: use 2 cups water for 1 cup rice (for Basmati a little less than 2 cups, for Japanese rice it is 1.1 cup water for 1 cup rice). The cup I use is 200 ml. I wash the rice a few times to get rid of dust and also of the rice flour from polishing. For Japanese rice, you should not just rinse it but also actually “wash” the rice by gently rubbing the grains together between your fingers. A detailed explanation can be found at Makiko Itoh’s site Just Hungry. To cook the 1 cup of rice in the microwave: Put the rice with the water in a microwave-compatible pot with a lid Cook at full power (900W) for one and a half minutes Cook at reduced power (40%, 360W) for 15 minutes. For basmati or Japanese rice this is enough; wholegrain rice takes more time, about 25 minutes. Check if all the water is gone, if not give it another 5 minutes, then check again. To cook the 1 cup of rice on the hob: Put the rice with the water in pot with a lid Bring to the boil Cook over low heat for about 15-20 minutes. For basmati or Japanese rice this is enough; wholegrain rice takes about 25-30 minutes.

For basmati or Japanese rice this is enough; wholegrain rice takes about 25-30 minutes. Cooking potatoes If you use the microwave, cooking potatoes is again very easy: Wash the potatoes and cut out any eyes or damaged parts, but don’t peel them. You can either cook large potatoes whole or chop them up into small chunks. If you like them whole, pierce them several times with a fork. Put in the microwave at full power for about 10 minutes (for 500g potatoes). Check if they are ready by pricking with a fork or just tasting. If they are not ready, give it another 5 minutes, then check again. Wash the potatoes and cut out any eyes or damaged parts, but don’t peel them.

If they are not ready, give it another 5 minutes, then check again. You can of course cook them on the hob as well but the microwave is a better option, it is quicker and the cooked potatoes taste better too. Cooking pasta Pasta is one of the few foods that I do not cook in the microwave, because you need a large pot with plenty of water. My approach is a bit different from what most other people do, but again very easy: Bring 2 l of water to the boil with a bit of salt (say 1/2 tsp) When the water is boiling heavily, add the pasta (100 g per person) and stir until all the pasta is submerged. Cook for 3 minutes in heavily boiling water, without a lid. Take the pot off the hob, put the lid on and let it stand for the remainder of the time indicated on the package. For example if the cooking time on the package says 12 minutes (quite typical), then leave it for 9 minutes. Strain, sprinkle with some olive oil and serve.

The Survival Store lists the food items that I have in the cupboard because I use them a lot, but also so that I can cook up a meal in an emergency. And the Specialty Corner is a short list of the less common ingredients, mainly for Japanese food. The Condiment Starter Kit There are a few condiments that I use quite a lot. If you have these you can make all the recipes. Nuts and seeds are very tasty when roasted, and provide a very interesting texture as well. pumpkin seeds sunflower seeds sesame seeds walnuts cashew nuts pumpkin seeds sunflower seeds sesame seeds walnuts cashew nuts I use ginger and cumin in many of the recipes.

I will regularly add recipes, follow me to get updates: The recipes will be organised in four categories: Quick recipes Emergency recipes Special occasion recipes Japanese recipes Quick recipes Emergency recipes Special occasion recipes Japanese recipes Most of the recipes will be in the “quick” category. The “emergency” recipes are recipes made only with ingredients from the store cupboard. The “special occasion” recipes are a bit more involved and take a bit longer to prepare. The Japanese recipes are usually quick but you need some Japanese ingredients. Quick recipes “Imam bayildi” is Turkish for “the priest has fainted”, and a very well-known Turkish aubergine dish. Usually the aubergines are scooped out and then stuffed, but as that takes longer, in this recipe I simply chop them. The original recipe also uses a lot of onion, which I don’t like. The characteristic spice in this dish is allspice, also known as Jamaica pepper. I serve this with maftoul (Palestinian or giant couscous) and feta and garnish with some lime wedges. Turkish-style - vegetarian - healthy - 20 minutes For two people: Fresh ingredients and groceries 1 large aubergine 2 medium tomatoes 1/2 pack feta (Greek goat cheese) 1 lime 1 cup of maftoul (Palestinian or giant couscous) From the store cupboard a handful of pine kernels 1 tablespoon ground allspice some salt or soy sauce optionally some sugar some garlic oil some olive oil (1 tablespoon) for frying Fresh ingredients and groceries 1 large aubergine 2 medium tomatoes 1/2 pack feta (Greek goat cheese) 1 lime 1 cup of maftoul (Palestinian or giant couscous) Fresh ingredients and groceries 1 large aubergine 2 medium tomatoes 1/2 pack feta (Greek goat cheese) 1 lime 1 cup of maftoul (Palestinian or giant couscous) 1 large aubergine 2 medium tomatoes 1/2 pack feta (Greek goat cheese) 1 lime 1 cup of maftoul (Palestinian or giant couscous) From the store cupboard a handful of pine kernels 1 tablespoon ground allspice some salt or soy sauce optionally some sugar some garlic oil some olive oil (1 tablespoon) for frying From the store cupboard a handful of pine kernels 1 tablespoon ground allspice some salt or soy sauce optionally some sugar some garlic oil some olive oil (1 tablespoon) for frying a handful of pine kernels 1 tablespoon ground allspice some salt or soy sauce optionally some sugar some garlic oil some olive oil (1 tablespoon) for frying Wash the aubergine and cut into slices of about half a cm thick. Put the aubergine slices in a microwave pot with 2 tablespoons water and cook for 5 minutes at full power (900W), stir, then cook for 3 more minutes on full power. Put the couscous in a microwave pot with 1.5 cups of water and a teaspoon soy sauce. Cook for 90 s at full power, then for about 10 minutes at 40%. It’s ready when almost all liquid has been absorbed. Fluff it up with a fork and add some lime juice and lime wedges (about half a lime). Heat the oil in a deep pan. Fry the spices and the pine kernels for a few minutes over medium to low heat. Add the finely chopped tomatoes and fry for a few more minutes, until the tomatoes start to soften. Add the aubergines, juice of half a lime and maybe a pinch of sugar, and fry for a few more minutes at low heat Serve with the couscous and feta.

Risotto is a popular Italian-style one-pan dish, delicious and easy to make. It works best with a proper risotto rice like Arborio. I like to serve it with an apple and cherry tomato side salad for contrast. This recipe takes about 30 minutes to prepare. Italian-style - vegetarian - healthy - 30 minutes For two people: Fresh ingredients and groceries pack of oyster mushrooms (150 g) 1 teaspoon ginger, finely chopped half a cup of grated hard cheese (Grana Padano or Parmezan) From the store cupboard 1 cup of risotto rice 2 tablespoons pine kernels 4 dried tomatoes 1 teaspoon turmeric 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1/2 teaspoon salt olive oil for frying (1 tablespoon) 1 teaspoon garlic oil (optional) Fresh ingredients and groceries pack of oyster mushrooms (150 g) 1 teaspoon ginger, finely chopped half a cup of grated hard cheese (Grana Padano or Parmezan) pack of oyster mushrooms (150 g) 1 teaspoon ginger, finely chopped half a cup of grated hard cheese (Grana Padano or Parmezan) pack of oyster mushrooms (150 g) 1 teaspoon ginger, finely chopped half a cup of grated hard cheese (Grana Padano or Parmezan) From the store cupboard 1 cup of risotto rice 2 tablespoons pine kernels 4 dried tomatoes 1 teaspoon turmeric 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1/2 teaspoon salt olive oil for frying (1 tablespoon) 1 teaspoon garlic oil (optional) 1 cup of risotto rice 2 tablespoons pine kernels 4 dried tomatoes 1 teaspoon turmeric 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1/2 teaspoon salt olive oil for frying (1 tablespoon) 1 teaspoon garlic oil (optional) 1 cup of risotto rice 2 tablespoons pine kernels 4 dried tomatoes 1 teaspoon turmeric 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1/2 teaspoon salt olive oil for frying (1 tablespoon) 1 teaspoon garlic oil (optional) Boil half a litre of water. Use some of it (1 cup) to soak the dried tomatoes. While the tomatoes are soaking: Heat the oil and fry the pine kernels, spices and the oyster mushrooms. Add the rice, shake or stir until it’s covered with the spices and the oil. Add some hot water (just enough to cover the rice) and simmer, covered, until the rice has absorbed the water. Add the tomatoes and their soaking liquid, and some more boiled water, stir and simmer, covered, until the rice has absorbed all the liquid. Add the salt and more water, stir and simmer, covered, until the rice has absorbed the water. You may have to add water a few more times, depending on how much you added at a time. It’s ready when the rice is quite creamy (in Italian it’s called all’onda, “wavy”). Boil half a litre of water. Use some of it (1 cup) to soak the dried tomatoes.

Cranberries are very sour so I combine them with apples to sweeten them. The mushrooms make the dish hearty and the chick peas add crunchiness. vegan - healthy - 20 minutes For two people: Fresh ingredients and groceries two small apples (I used 1 1/2 large ones) 1 mug of frozen cranberries pack of chestnut mushrooms (ordinary mushrooms are fine too) 1 tin chickpeas 1 teaspoon chopped ginger From the store cupboard 1 teaspoon ground cumin 2 tablespoon sunflower seeds 2 tablespoon sesame seeds 1 cup basmati rice 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoon soy sauce Fresh ingredients and groceries two small apples (I used 1 1/2 large ones) 1 mug of frozen cranberries pack of chestnut mushrooms (ordinary mushrooms are fine too) 1 tin chickpeas 1 teaspoon chopped ginger two small apples (I used 1 1/2 large ones) 1 mug of frozen cranberries pack of chestnut mushrooms (ordinary mushrooms are fine too) 1 tin chickpeas 1 teaspoon chopped ginger two small apples (I used 1 1/2 large ones) 1 mug of frozen cranberries pack of chestnut mushrooms (ordinary mushrooms are fine too) 1 tin chickpeas 1 teaspoon chopped ginger From the store cupboard 1 teaspoon ground cumin 2 tablespoon sunflower seeds 2 tablespoon sesame seeds 1 cup basmati rice 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoon soy sauce 1 teaspoon ground cumin 2 tablespoon sunflower seeds 2 tablespoon sesame seeds 1 cup basmati rice 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoon soy sauce 1 teaspoon ground cumin 2 tablespoon sunflower seeds 2 tablespoon sesame seeds 1 cup basmati rice 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoon soy sauce Cook the rice (see basics for how to cook rice).

Serve with the rice. Leave a comment This very tasty recipe takes about 30 minutes to prepare. It is a mild root vegetable curry with a base of spices and seeds. The paneer (Indian fresh cheese, available in most supermarkets) is great when fried like this with sunflower seeds and turmeric. I also make this recipe with chickpeas instead, and prepare it in quite the same way. curry - vegetarian - healthy - 30 minutes For two people: Fresh ingredients and groceries carrots, parsnips, potatoes and a small sweet potato (about 1/2 kg all together) 2 small tomatoes paneer (Indian fresh cheese) (1 pack) fresh ginger (1 tablespoon chopped finely) From the store cupboard 1 cup basmati rice spices: ground cumin seeds (1 teaspoon), ground coriander seeds (1 teaspoon), ground turmeric (2 teaspoons), cayenne pepper or nanami togarashi (Japanese spice mix) (1 teaspoon) seeds and nuts: sunflower seeds and/or sesame seeds (2 tablespoons), cashew nuts (1 cup) soy sauce (1 tablespoon) oil for cooking (I use olive oil) (1 tablespoon) optional: garlic oil (1 teaspoon) Fresh ingredients and groceries carrots, parsnips, potatoes and a small sweet potato (about 1/2 kg all together) 2 small tomatoes paneer (Indian fresh cheese) (1 pack) fresh ginger (1 tablespoon chopped finely) Fresh ingredients and groceries carrots, parsnips, potatoes and a small sweet potato (about 1/2 kg all together) 2 small tomatoes paneer (Indian fresh cheese) (1 pack) fresh ginger (1 tablespoon chopped finely) carrots, parsnips, potatoes and a small sweet potato (about 1/2 kg all together) 2 small tomatoes paneer (Indian fresh cheese) (1 pack) fresh ginger (1 tablespoon chopped finely) From the store cupboard 1 cup basmati rice spices: ground cumin seeds (1 teaspoon), ground coriander seeds (1 teaspoon), ground turmeric (2 teaspoons), cayenne pepper or nanami togarashi (Japanese spice mix) (1 teaspoon) seeds and nuts: sunflower seeds and/or sesame seeds (2 tablespoons), cashew nuts (1 cup) soy sauce (1 tablespoon) oil for cooking (I use olive oil) (1 tablespoon) optional: garlic oil (1 teaspoon) From the store cupboard 1 cup basmati rice spices: ground cumin seeds (1 teaspoon), ground coriander seeds (1 teaspoon), ground turmeric (2 teaspoons), cayenne pepper or nanami togarashi (Japanese spice mix) (1 teaspoon) seeds and nuts: sunflower seeds and/or sesame seeds (2 tablespoons), cashew nuts (1 cup) soy sauce (1 tablespoon) oil for cooking (I use olive oil) (1 tablespoon) optional: garlic oil (1 teaspoon) 1 cup basmati rice spices: ground cumin seeds (1 teaspoon), ground coriander seeds (1 teaspoon), ground turmeric (2 teaspoons), cayenne pepper or nanami togarashi (Japanese spice mix) (1 teaspoon) seeds and nuts: sunflower seeds and/or sesame seeds (2 tablespoons), cashew nuts (1 cup) soy sauce (1 tablespoon) oil for cooking (I use olive oil) (1 tablespoon) optional: garlic oil (1 teaspoon) Cook the rice (see basics for how to cook rice).

You can use in instead of rice for risotto-style dishes. It goes really well with porcini mushrooms. The ricotta cheese makes it creamy and mild. I like to serve it with a rocket, apple and cherry tomato side salad. This recipe takes about 30 minutes to prepare. Italian-style - vegetarian - healthy - 30 minutes For two people: Fresh ingredients: 1 pack chestnut mushrooms 150 g ricotta 50 g grated grana padano or parmezan 1 tablespoon ginger, chopped finely From the store cupboard: 1/2 cup dried porcini mushrooms 5 dried tomatoes 3 tablespoon pine kernels 1 teaspoon cumin, coriander 1 cup orzo 1 tablespoon olive oil garlic oil (optional) Fresh ingredients: 1 pack chestnut mushrooms 150 g ricotta 50 g grated grana padano or parmezan 1 tablespoon ginger, chopped finely 1 pack chestnut mushrooms 150 g ricotta 50 g grated grana padano or parmezan 1 tablespoon ginger, chopped finely 1 pack chestnut mushrooms 150 g ricotta 50 g grated grana padano or parmezan 1 tablespoon ginger, chopped finely From the store cupboard: 1/2 cup dried porcini mushrooms 5 dried tomatoes 3 tablespoon pine kernels 1 teaspoon cumin, coriander 1 cup orzo 1 tablespoon olive oil garlic oil (optional) 1/2 cup dried porcini mushrooms 5 dried tomatoes 3 tablespoon pine kernels 1 teaspoon cumin, coriander 1 cup orzo 1 tablespoon olive oil garlic oil (optional) 1/2 cup dried porcini mushrooms 5 dried tomatoes 3 tablespoon pine kernels 1 teaspoon cumin, coriander 1 cup orzo 1 tablespoon olive oil garlic oil (optional) Soak the dried porcini mushrooms in hot water for about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the orzo together with the dried tomatoes. Orzo is cooked just like regular pasta. When the orzo is ready, fish the soaked tomatoes from the pot, then drain. Heat the olive oil and fry the pine kernels, ginger and spices for a few minutes, then add the chestnut mushrooms. Stir-fry for a few more minutes until the mushrooms start to release their liquid. Squeeze most of the water out of the porcini mushrooms and add them to the pan. Add the dried tomatoes and orzo to the pan and stir. Spoon the ricotta into the pan, stirring gently. Drizzle on some garlic oil and serve with grated cheese sprinkled on top. Soak the dried porcini mushrooms in hot water for about 15 minutes.
