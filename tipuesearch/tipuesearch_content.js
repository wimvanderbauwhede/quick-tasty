So I focus on tasty, healthy meals that are simple and easy to make in a short time. I mostly use ingredients that are easy to find in any supermarket, and most of my recipes take less than 30 minutes to put on the table. I’ve lived in Japan for a short time and I’ve been influenced by the Japanese kitchen, with its emphasis on simplicity, and so I will include some Japanese recipes as well. The picture was taken at the Matsuo shrine in Kyoto. The vegetables are offerings to the Shinto deities.

The Condiment Starter Kit lists all the condiments you need for my recipes. The Survival Store lists the food items that I have in the cupboard because I use them a lot, but also so that I can cook up a meal in an emergency. And the Specialty Corner is a short list of the less common ingredients, mainly for Japanese food. The Condiment Starter Kit There are a few condiments that I use quite a lot, if you have these you can make all the recipes. Nuts and seeds are very tasty when roasted, and provide a very interesting texture as well. pumpkin seeds sunflower seeds sesame seeds walnuts cashew nuts pumpkin seeds sunflower seeds sesame seeds walnuts cashew nuts I use ginger and cumin in many of the recipes. Turmeric, coriander and cardamom are for the more curry-style recipes. fresh ginger cumin seeds turmeric coriander seeds cardamom pods fresh ginger cumin seeds turmeric coriander seeds cardamom pods Dried tomatoes are my favourite condiment because they add a lot of taste to the food and make it look nice too. Dried mushrooms are great for risottos and similar dishes. dried tomatoes (just dry, not in oil) dried mushrooms (porcini or mixed) olive oil soy sauce (make sure it is “real” soy sauce, made from soy, wheat and salt and nothing else) rice vinegar, wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar dried tomatoes (just dry, not in oil) dried mushrooms (porcini or mixed) olive oil soy sauce (make sure it is “real” soy sauce, made from soy, wheat and salt and nothing else) rice vinegar, wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar The Survival Store These are items that keep for a very long time and allow you to whip up a meal in an emergency. rice (I usually use basmati because it has a great taste and it cooks very quickly) pasta (I keep both Italian-style pasta and Japanese-style noodles) chick peas (dried or tin) frozen peas and/or soy beans silken tofu, this is tofu (soy bean protein) in tetra pak. rice (I usually use basmati because it has a great taste and it cooks very quickly) pasta (I keep both Italian-style pasta and Japanese-style noodles) chick peas (dried or tin) frozen peas and/or soy beans silken tofu, this is tofu (soy bean protein) in tetra pak. The Specialty Corner These are a few ingredients that are a bit harder to find, usually for Japanese meals: shichimi togarashi, a Japanese spice mixture. mirin, a sweet rice wine for cooking. miso paste, a paste made from salt and fermented soy beans, somewhat similar to vegetable stock cubes but much nicer. wakame seaweed, for use in stews and miso soup. konbu seaweed, for making dashi, the base for many Japanese dishes. hijiki seaweed, great for stews and salads. dulse, a local seaweed, not Japanese but a very tasty. shichimi togarashi, a Japanese spice mixture. mirin, a sweet rice wine for cooking. miso paste, a paste made from salt and fermented soy beans, somewhat similar to vegetable stock cubes but much nicer. wakame seaweed, for use in stews and miso soup. konbu seaweed, for making dashi, the base for many Japanese dishes. hijiki seaweed, great for stews and salads. dulse, a local seaweed, not Japanese but a very tasty.

I will regularly add recipes. They will be organised in four categories: Quick recipes Emergency recipes Special occasion recipes Japanese recipes Quick recipes Emergency recipes Special occasion recipes Japanese recipes Most of the recipes will be in the “quick” category. The “emergency” recipes are recipes made only with ingredients from the store cupboard. The “special occasion” recipes are a bit more involved and take a bit longer to prepare. The Japanese recipes are usually quick but you need some Japanese ingredients. Quick recipes This is one of my favourite recipes, very easy to make, ready in 15 minutes and very tasty. You can also make this with courgettes instead of tomatoes. 4 large tomatoes 200-250 g halloumi cheese (1 pack) a handful of pumpkin seeds 1 cup of basmati rice, slightly less than 2 cups of water 4 large tomatoes 200-250 g halloumi cheese (1 pack) a handful of pumpkin seeds 1 cup of basmati rice, slightly less than 2 cups of water Cook the rice (see basics for how to cook rice). While the rice is cooking: Cut the tomatoes in half. Take a shallow dish with a lid, large enough to so that you can put the tomato halves next to one another. I use a heat resistant glass dish. Cut the halloumi in thin slices (2-3 mm) and cover the tomatoes with it. Sprinkle the pumpkin seeds on top. Put the lid on and put in the microwave for 5 minutes at full power (assuming a 900W microwave, Cat. E). Let it sit for 1-2 minutes, then cook for another 2 minutes at full power.

All of these are actually very easy. Cooking rice Cooking rice is very easy. The basic rule is: use 2 cups water for 1 cup rice (for Basmati a little less than 2 cups, for Japanese rice it is 1.1 cup water for 1 cup rice). The cup I use is 200 ml. I wash the rice a few times to get rid of dust and also of the rice flour from polishing. To cook the 1 cup of rice in the microwave: Put the rice with the water in a microwave-compatible pot with a lid Cook at full power (900W) for one and a half minutes Cook at reduced power (40%, 360W) for 15 minutes. For basmati or Japanese rice this is enough; wholegrain rice takes more time, about 25 minutes. Check if all the water is gone, if not give it another 5 minutes, then check again. To cook the 1 cup of rice on the hob: Put the rice with the water in pot with a lid Bring to the boil Cook over low heat for about 15-20 minutes. For basmati or Japanese rice this is enough; wholegrain rice takes about 25-30 minutes.

Cooking potatoes If you use the microwave, cooking potatoes is again very easy: Wash the potatoes and cut out any eyes or damaged parts, but don’t peel them. You can either cook large potatoes whole or chop them up into small chunks. If you like them whole, pierce them several times with a fork. Put in the microwave at full power for about 10 minutes (for 500g potatoes). Check if they are ready by pricking with a fork or just tasting. If they are not ready, give it another 5 minutes, then check again. Wash the potatoes and cut out any eyes or damaged parts, but don’t peel them.

If they are not ready, give it another 5 minutes, then check again. You can of course cook them on the hob as well but the microwave is a better option, it is quicker and the cooked potatoes taste better too. Cooking pasta Pasta is one of the few foods that I do not cook in the microwave, because you need a large pot with plenty of water. My approach is a bit different from what most other people do, but again very easy: Bring 2 l of water to the boil with a bit of salt (say 1/2 tsp) When the water is boiling heavily, add the pasta (100 g per person) and stir until all the pasta is submerged. Cook for 3 minutes in heavily boiling water, without a lid. Take the pot off the hob, put the lid on and let it stand for the remainder of the time indicated on the package. For example if the cooking time on the package says 12 minutes (quite typical), then leave it for 9 minutes. Strain, sprinkle with some olive oil and serve.
