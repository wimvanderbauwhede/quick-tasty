Hi, I'm Wim and I have been cooking for 25 years. I like to cook but I don't have much time as I have a full-time job. So I focus on tasty, healthy meals that are simple and easy to make in a short time.

I mostly use ingredients that are easy to find in any supermarket, and most of my recipes take less than 30 minutes to put on the table.  

My goal with Wim's Quick and Tasty Food is to write a cookbook and donate the proceeds to the [UN World Food Programme](http://www.wfp.org/). For a publisher to take interest, I need to have many, many followers on Facebook and Twitter. Please help me to achieve this goal by liking my Facebook page or following me on Twitter:

I've lived in Japan for a short time and I've been influenced by the Japanese kitchen, with its emphasis on simplicity, and so I <!--have included--> will include some Japanese recipes as well.
