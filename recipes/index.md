All my recipes are for _full meals_ for two people.

I will regularly add recipes, follow me to get updates:

{% include follow-us.html %}

The recipes will be organised in four categories:

* Quick recipes
* Emergency recipes
* Special occasion recipes
* Japanese recipes

Most of the recipes will be in the "quick" category. The "emergency" recipes are recipes made only with ingredients from the store cupboard. The "special occasion" recipes are a bit more involved and take a bit longer to prepare. The Japanese recipes are usually quick but you need some Japanese ingredients.

## Quick recipes

### Stuffed courgettes with gnocchi<a name="stuffed_courgettes_gnocchi"></a>

![Stuffed courgettes with gnocchi]({{ site.url }}/images/stuffed_courgettes_gnocchi_1600.jpg)

This is a very simple recipe with few ingredients and ready in about 20 minutes.

Ingredients:

- 3 small courgettes (500 g)
- 1 pack gnocchi (500 g)
- brown breadcrumbs (1 cup)
- 50 g hard cheese (grana padano or parmezan), grated
- 1 tablespoon garlic oil

Preparation:

- Slice the courgettes in half and scoop out the flesh. Put the scooped-out courgettes in a microwave dish.
- Cut the scooped-out flesh fine and mix with the breadcrumbs in another microwave dish.
- Put both dishes in the microwave at full power (900W). Cook for 5 minutes if together, for 3 minutes each if separately.
- Fill the courgette halves with the mixture. Sprinkle each of them with a little garlic oil and cover with the grated cheese.
- Cook the gnocchi: simply put them in boiling water until they float to the top (about 3 minutes).
- Meanwhile, cook the stuffed courgette halves in the microwave at full power (900W) for 3 minutes.


### Curry of potatoes, spinach and paneer<a name="pot_spin_pan"></a>

![Curry of potatoes, spinach and paneer]({{ site.url }}/images/pot_spin_pan_1600.jpg)

This very tasty recipe takes about 30 minutes to prepare, it's a mild potato curry with a base of spices and seeds. The paneer (Indian fresh cheese, available in most supermarkets) is great when fried like this with sesame seeds and turmeric. I also make this recipe with chick peas instead, and prepare it in quite the same way.

#### Ingredients:
- about 400 g small potatoes
- 2 large tomatoes
- about 200 g spinach
- 1 pack of paneer (about 200 g)
- 1 cm fresh ginger
- spices: turmeric, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, cardamom pods, cayenne pepper to taste (I use about a teaspoon of each of the spices and just a pinch of the cayenne pepper)
- seeds: sesame, sunflower, some pumpkin (I use about 1 table spoon of each)
- 1 table spoon of soy sauce
- oil for cooking (I use olive oil)
- optional: garlic oil

#### Preparation:
- Wash the potatoes and cut them in two. Cook them in the microwave.
- Chop the tomatoes very fine.
- If you're using whole seeds like I do, grind the coriander seeds, cumin seeds and cardamom pods.
- Chop the ginger very fine.
- Cut the paneer into cubes of about 1 cm on the side.
- Heat the oil in a large deep pan. I recommend a non-stick pan with a lid.
- When the oil is hot, add the ginger, seeds and spices and fry over medium heat for a few minutes.
- Add the paneer and stir until it is evenly covered with the seeds and spices.
- Fry for a few minutes more over medium heat, then turn up the heat for 30 seconds or so.
- Clear some space in the middle of the pan and put in the soy sauce. Stir vigorously.
- Add the tomatoes and stir well. Lower the heat and leave to simmer for a few minutes until the tomatoes have softened. You can speed this up by first putting the chopped tomatoes in the microwave for 2 minutes.
- Cook the spinach in the microwave at full power (900W) for 1 minute.
- Meanwhile, add the potatoes to the pan, stir until the potatoes are no longer looking white.
- Cut up the spinach. Add the spinach to the pan, stir and let simmer for a few more minutes.
- Add garlic oil to taste.

This is really a complete one-pan meal but sometimes I serve it with rice too.

### Tomatoes with halloumi and pumpkin seeds, served with basmati rice<a name="tom_hal"></a>

![Tomatoes with halloumi and pumpkin seeds]({{ site.url }}/images/tom_hal_1600.jpg)

This is one of my favourite recipes, very easy to make, ready in 15 minutes and very tasty. You can also make this with courgettes instead of tomatoes.

#### Ingredients:
- 4 large tomatoes
- 200-250 g halloumi cheese (1 pack)
- a handful of pumpkin seeds
- 1 cup of basmati rice, slightly less than 2 cups of water

#### Preparation:
- Cook the rice (see <a href="{{ site.url }}/basics">basics</a> for how to cook rice).
- While the rice is cooking:
	- Cut the tomatoes in half.
	- Take a shallow dish with a lid, large enough to so that you can put the tomato halves next to one another. I use a heat resistant glass dish.
	- Cut the halloumi in thin slices (2-3 mm) and cover the tomatoes with it.
	- Sprinkle the pumpkin seeds on top.
	- Put the lid on and put in the microwave for 5 minutes at full power (assuming a 900W microwave, Cat. E).
	- Let it sit for 1-2 minutes, then cook for another 2 minutes at full power.
- If you used basmati rice, it will be ready too, serve and enjoy!

### Nifty pasta<a name="nifty_pasta"></a>

This is a basic pasta recipe with a cold topping that is again very easy to make and ready in 15 minutes.

#### Ingredients:

- About 200 g small tomatoes
- Two packs of mozzarella, or alternatively a pack of mini mozzarella balls
- A serving of artichokes in oil or similar antipasti
- A handful of walnuts
- 200 g linguine or spaghetti

#### Preparation:

- Cook the linguine (see <a href="{{ site.url }}/basics">basics</a> for how to cook pasta).
- While the pasta is cooking, cut tomatoes, mozzarella and artichokes in small bits. I usually serve each in a separate small bowl.
- When the pasta is ready, serve with the toppings and put some walnuts on top.
