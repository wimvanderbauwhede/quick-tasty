All my recipes are for _full meals_ for two people.

I will regularly add recipes. They will be organised in four categories:

* Quick recipes
* Emergency recipes
* Special occasion recipes
* Japanese recipes

Most of the recipes will be in the "quick" category. The "emergency" recipes are recipes made only with ingredients from the store cupboard. The "special occasion" recipes are a bit more involved and take a bit longer to prepare. The Japanese recipes are usually quick but you need some Japanese ingredients.

## Quick recipes

### Tomatoes with halloumi and pumpkin seeds, served with basmati rice<a name="tom_hal"></a>

![Tomatoes with halloumi and pumpkin seeds]({{ site.url }}/images/tom_hal_1600.jpg)

This is one of my favourite recipes, very easy to make, ready in 15 minutes and very tasty. You can also make this with courgettes instead of tomatoes.

#### Ingredients:
- 4 large tomatoes
- 200-250 g halloumi cheese (1 pack)
- a handful of pumpkin seeds
- 1 cup of basmati rice, slightly less than 2 cups of water

#### Preparation:
- Cook the rice (see <a href="{{ site.url }}/basics">basics</a> for how to cook rice).
- While the rice is cooking:
	- Cut the tomatoes in half.
	- Take a shallow dish with a lid, large enough to so that you can put the tomato halves next to one another. I use a heat resistant glass dish.
	- Cut the halloumi in thin slices (2-3 mm) and cover the tomatoes with it.
	- Sprinkle the pumpkin seeds on top.
	- Put the lid on and put in the microwave for 5 minutes at full power (assuming a 900W microwave, Cat. E).
	- Let it sit for 1-2 minutes, then cook for another 2 minutes at full power.
- If you used basmati rice, it will be ready too, serve and enjoy!

### Nifty pasta<a name="nifty_pasta"></a>

This is a basic pasta recipe with a cold topping that is again very easy to make and ready in 15 minutes.

#### Ingredients:

- About 200 g small tomatoes
- Two packs of mozzarella, or alternatively a pack of mini mozzarella balls
- A serving of artichokes in oil or similar antipasti
- A handful of walnuts
- 200 g linguine or spaghetti

#### Preparation:

- Cook the linguine (see <a href="{{ site.url }}/basics">basics</a> for how to cook pasta).
- While the pasta is cooking, cut tomatoes, mozzarella and artichokes in small bits. I usually serve each in a separate small bowl.
- When the pasta is ready, serve with the toppings and put some walnuts on top.
