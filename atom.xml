        	&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quickandtastycooking.org.uk/articles/learning-japanese&quot;&gt;my previous post about learning Japanese&lt;/a&gt; I mentioned that I am very slowly reading a book (“1Q84” by Haruki Murakami) in Japanese. (It’s now July 2016 and I’ve finally finished the first volume!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;!--In this post I&#39;d like to explain how I, as a learner, read a Japanese text. I --&gt;
This post is about reading Japanese. I’ll give some tips on how to look up kanji and a few handy rules to simplify the reading process. I haven’t really encountered these tips and rules as such in my learning materials, so I thought they may be of interest to other learners as well.
&lt;!--
, so it&#39;s probably mostly of interest to other learners of Japanese.
--&gt;
&lt;!--
Reading a Japanese text as a learner is very different from reading --&gt;&lt;!--a text--&gt;&lt;!-- in a language that uses an alphabet.--&gt;&lt;!--, like English. In English, --&gt;&lt;!--When you know the alphabet, you can --&gt;&lt;!--read the words in a text. You may not know what they mean, but it is easy to--&gt;&lt;!-- look them up in a dictionary--&gt;&lt;!-- thanks to the ordering of the alphabet--&gt;&lt;!--.
--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-kanji-conundrum&quot;&gt;The kanji conundrum&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When learning to read in a language that uses an alphabet, you can simply look up any word you don’t know in a dictionary. Because of the use of &lt;em&gt;kanji&lt;/em&gt; (漢字, Chinese characters), things are more complicated for the learner of Japanese. Words written in &lt;em&gt;katakana&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;hiragana&lt;/em&gt; (the sets of about fifty characters used to write Japanese phonetically) are easy to look it up. But what to do with kanji? There are about two thousand kanji in general use. Learning them all takes a long time: in the Japanese school system, it takes nine years. &lt;!-- I have, after 5 years of learning, studied about a thousand of them, but I can&#39;t claim the really know them completely: t--&gt; Typically each kanji has several possible readings (pronunciation) and meanings. &lt;!--, and I don&#39;t always remember them all. And even if I did, that would still not help me for--&gt; And knowing every meaning of every kanji does not mean knowing the meaning of words that use combinations of kanji.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reading-for-learning&quot;&gt;Reading for learning&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, reading for learning is different from ordinary reading. Normally, I read to understand the meaning of a text. When learning Japanese, I also want to learn the readings of the kanji I encounter and I want to practise recall of the kanji and compound words that I’ve  already learnt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually I make a first pass through a page of the text without looking anything up, trying to remember as much as possible, both readings and meanings, and to guess at readings and meanings of compound words where possible. Very often the context helps to guess at meanings, so I make sure to read enough text to get sufficient context.
Then in a second pass I look up every kanji for which I don’t know either the reading or the meaning, and every compound word that I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;looking-up-kanji&quot;&gt;Looking up kanji&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that the most convenient way to look up a kanji is an electronic dictionary on a smartphone, because I need to know just one of the readings. If I don’t know any of the readings, I use three different ways, depending on the kanji. All of them require understanding of the basics of kanji writing and structure: the stroke order, stroke count and the “radicals”, the kanji building blocks that make up the more complex kanji.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The first way is to draw the kanji stroke by stroke. I prefer this approach as a learner, because I tend to remember the kanji better if I’ve had to write it. Typically, a kanji writing app will present a list of kanji that match the handwritten one. If my writing was good, I’ll get the kanji I was looking for on the first page.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The second approach is to look up the kanji by radical. Most electronic dictionaries offer that facility. It usually works well if the radicals making up the kanji are clear. It really helps to know how to count the strokes in a radical, because they are usually ordered by stroke count.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My final way is to use a (paper) dictionary with the SKIP (System of Kanji Indexing by Patterns) system for ordering kanji. I have the well-known “Kodansha Kanji Learner’s Dictionary”. The SKIP method is based on first classifying the kanji into one of 4 groups (Left-Right ◧, Up-Down ⬒, Enclosure ◻, and Solid ◼). For the first two categories, further indexing is by stroke count of both parts. Kanji in the third category (enclosure) are indexed by the number of sides of the enclosure. Kanji in the last category typically can’t always be broken down, but there aren’t that many of them and most of them are simple kanji.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Kanji dictionary page&quot; src=&quot;http://www.quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/kanji_learners_dict_1600&quot; alt=&quot;Kanji dictionary page&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reading-for-learners-a-few-handy-rules&quot;&gt;Reading for learners: a few handy rules&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the many readings and meanings may sound horribly complicated, I found that there are actually a few general rules that simplify the reading process. Of course there are exceptions to all of these rules but they hold most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kanji have typically two types of readings, called &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; (音,”sound”) and &lt;em&gt;kun&lt;/em&gt; (訓,”instruction” or “explanation”). The &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt;-reading is based on the sound of the original Chinese reading of a character; the &lt;em&gt;kun&lt;/em&gt;-reading is the Japanese word with the same meaning. Chinese used to play a similar role as Latin or Greek in ancient Japan, so in a way &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt;-readings are comparable with words with a Latin or Greek root in English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The first  general rule is that kanji appearing on their own (i.e. not in combination with other kanji) have almost always the &lt;em&gt;kun&lt;/em&gt;-reading. For example, for the kanji 食, it will be one of the four &lt;em&gt;kun&lt;/em&gt;-readings (く.う “ku-u”, く.らう “ku-rau”, た.べる “ta-beru” or は.む “ha-mu”), not one of the &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt;-readings. To select the correct &lt;em&gt;kun&lt;/em&gt;-reading, look at the hiragana following the kanji so 食う is pronounced as “kuu” and 食べる is pronounced as “taberu”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The second general rule is that in a compound word, all kanji have either the &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt;- or the &lt;em&gt;kun&lt;/em&gt;-reading. And for the vast majority of the compound words, it will be the &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt;-reading. For example, 食事 is shokuji (&lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt;-&lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt;), not “ta-ji” (&lt;em&gt;kun&lt;/em&gt;-&lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt;) or “shoku-koto” (&lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt;-&lt;em&gt;kun&lt;/em&gt;). Generally, there are fewer &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt;-readings than &lt;em&gt;kun&lt;/em&gt;-readings for a kanji, and &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt;-readings are also mostly single-syllable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Although there are indeed many &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt;- and &lt;em&gt;kun&lt;/em&gt;-readings, for most kanji one of each will be the most frequently used, and the others will likely be used only in fixed combinations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The same is true for meanings: usually one of the meanings is used much more frequently than all the others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!--
- Finally, meanings and readings are usually coupled, so a given meaning has a given reading.　For example 着 means &quot;arrive&quot; and &quot;wear&quot;, but &quot;arrive&quot; is always ”tsuku” and wear &quot;kiru&quot;. So 着る can only mean &quot;wear&quot; and 着く can only mean &quot;arrive&quot;.
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if reading a Japanese text may seem daunting at first, it is a very rewarding experience, and it is actually less complicated than it seems&lt;!-- would seem if you&#39;ve mostly focused on learning kanji--&gt;. I hope these tips and rules will help you to read Japanese more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">
        	&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/japanese-kitchen-tools_1600x600.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;The apartment where I stayed in Japan had a kitchen but no pots, pans, cutlery or anything. So I had to go and buy everything — great fun when you’re jet-lagged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to a supermarket and bought amongst other things a very sharp knife (partly showing on the banner of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quickandtastycooking.org.uk/recipes/&quot;&gt;recipes page&lt;/a&gt;), a great versatile microwave pot (featuring on the banner of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quickandtastycooking.org.uk/articles/microwave-cooking&quot;&gt;my post about the microwave&lt;/a&gt;), and the cheap-but-beautiful &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quickandtastycooking.org.uk/articles/murakami-meals/&quot;&gt;black-and-red bowls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also bought three kitchen tools that I particularly like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/japanese-kitchen-tools_1600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-flexible-antibacterial-cutting-mat&quot;&gt;A flexible, antibacterial cutting mat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mat contains a phytoncide, an antibacterial organic compound derived from plants. To kill all the germs you simply put it in the microwave for a minute. And it can go in the dishwasher as well. You can buy it on line, just search for “phytoncide cutting board”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-pair-of-bamboo-cooking-chopsticks&quot;&gt;A pair of bamboo cooking chopsticks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/long-chopsticks-detail_800.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long chopsticks are great for cooking pasta or noodles. No risk of burning your fingers and handier than a fork too. You can easily find plain ones but I liked the &lt;em&gt;sakura&lt;/em&gt; decoration (cherry blossoms), and it actually has ridges for a better grip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-rice-scoop&quot;&gt;A rice scoop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/rice-scoop_800.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese rice is different from other rice in the way it sticks together: when properly cooked, each grain is still quite firm but the grains have a sticky outer layer. That’s why every Japanese kitchen has a rice scoop like this, with little nobs that stop the rice from sticking to it. The scoop can be put upright on its handle, very nifty!&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;As promised in my previous post, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quickandtastycooking.org.uk/articles/learning-japanese/&quot;&gt;My journey of learning Japanese&lt;/a&gt;, I will start posting recipes for what I call “Murakami meals”, named after one of my favourite authors, Haruki Murakami.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami&quot;&gt;Haruki Murakami&lt;/a&gt; is a bestselling Japanese author. Food is a recurrent theme in his novels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the way he lets his characters prepare food, like Nakata in “Kafka on the Shore” peering in the fridge and whipping up a great meal in no time for himself and Hoshino, or Aomame in “1Q84” eating cucumber with mayonaise, or the narrator in “Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World” cooking for the librarian. &lt;!-- resp p368, p152, p90 --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--
Somebody made a very nice illustration of Nakata with Hoshino eating a bowl of ramen:
![Nakata and Hoshino](http://rittlerion.com/img/bigimg/07big.jpg &quot;Nakata and Hoshino&quot;)
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I call a “Murakami meal” is a meal made quickly with what you find in the fridge. And although Murakami frequently lets his characters prepare and eat Western-style food, I’ll post recipes for Japanese-style food. Also, of course, my recipes will be vegetarian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/aubergines-ponzu-soybeans-rice_1600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Aubergines with ponzu, soy beans, brown rice&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My “Murakami meal #1” is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quickandtastycooking.org.uk/recipes/#aubergines-ponzu-soybeans-rice&quot;&gt;aubergines with &lt;em&gt;ponzu&lt;/em&gt;, soy beans with &lt;em&gt;shiitake&lt;/em&gt; and brown rice with &lt;em&gt;konbu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;!--
 tamagoyaki (Japanese-style omelet) with ajizuki nori (seaweed), Japanese-style potato salad and silken tofu. I explain how to make it [on the recipes page](http://www.quickandtastycooking.org.uk/recipes/).

        <content type="html">
        	&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/kanji_1600x600.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;In early 2011, as a result of a press release about my work, a researcher from Japan contacted me and proposed a research collaboration. I had always been very interested in Japan, so this was a great opportunity. I started planning a research visit, and at that point I thought it would be better to learn some Japanese. So about three months before the trip I started my first Japanese lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, nobody told me one should not attempt to learn a new language over the age of forty. And anyone who has learned some Japanese will appreciate how ridiculously short a time three months is; luckily I didn’t know any better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, I started learning very basic Japanese and I loved it: the writing system, the grammar, the culture as expressed through the language. Learning your first kanji (Chinese characters used in Japanese) is a great experience, because kanji are mysterious, beautiful and concise – and you think you can see the logic to it. And learning the first phrases makes you feel it won’t be all that hard. It’s wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, I had to postpone my trip. But in the summer of 2012, having learned Japanese for a bit more than a year, I went to Kyoto for a two-month research visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was amazing: kanji everywhere! Somewhere along the path, learning Japanese had become a goal in its own right, not just a practical tool for survival in the wild. It was that as well, of course – just try shopping in a Japanese supermarket without knowing any Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img title=&quot;Kyoto street just after sunset&quot; src=&quot;http://www.quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/kyoto_street_night_600x800.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kyoto street after sunset&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I conversed in broken Japanese, and looked up kanji on my phone (and was surprised how many signs said “dentist”), and tried to improve my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/&quot;&gt;hiragana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana/&quot;&gt;katakana&lt;/a&gt; reading skills. I didn’t actively study, the total immersion was all I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that time I had learned only basic grammar and sentence structure, very little informal Japanese – my teacher does not hold with that – and about 100 of the 500 most frequent kanji. I quickly discovered that “most frequent” does not really mean “common” or vice versa. The “most frequent kanji” list is based on newspaper articles, so there are many common kanji that are not in that list. Also, “knowing” or “having learned” a kanji is a rather vague term, and being able to tick them off in a spaced repetition app like Anki or Memrise (great tools though they are!) does not mean you know the meaning of a word consisting of “known” kanji, let alone its pronunciation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kanji typically have several meanings, sometimes wildly different (e.g. 洗　means both “wash” and “inquire into”) and several readings, some based on the original Chinese pronunciation of the character, some on the Japanese pronunciation of the meaning of the character (e.g. 明日 “tomorrow” can be read as “ashita”, “asu” or “myonichi”). So there is a lot to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now I was hooked, by both the language and the country.  Two more years of study later I visited Japan again. On that visit I bought the paperback version of Haruki Murakami’s “1Q84”. It comes in 6 volumes, each about 400 pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/murakami_1Q84_1600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Paperback version of 1Q84 by 村上春樹, 6 volumes&amp;quot;&quot; title=&quot;1Q84 by 村上春樹&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started reading it on my return (October 2014). It is a slow process because really my Japanese is by far not good enough. I continuously encounter kanji that I have not learned yet or already forgotten, so I have to look them up. Luckily I can do this on my phone, by writing them stroke by stroke. It is now April 2016 and I have reached page 295 (of 357) in the first volume. At this rate, it will take me another 15 years to finish the book. This may not seem very encouraging. However, I hope of course that my reading skills will improve. And in fact I have found reading this way to be more enjoyable than reading the book in English translation: reading Japanese requires a deeper concentration and I feel more immersed in the story – and I find the Japanese writing simply beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The books have also inspired me to make a few “Murakami meals”, which I’ll be posting soon. Speaking of food, I also bought a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quickandtastycooking.org.uk/articles/zen-cooking/&quot;&gt;Zen temple cuisine cookbook&lt;/a&gt;, available in Japanese only. It gives a unique insight in the Zen way of cooking – and the language and vocabulary are much easier than Murakami’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’d like to thank my teacher Rie Ogura for her patience with me, waiting endlessly while I fumble for the right words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        	&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/microwave_1600x600.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;!-- &quot;The most underrated kitchen appliance&quot; --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The microwave oven is probably the most common appliance in any kitchen, but also the most underrated one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people use the microwave oven to heat ready meals or defrost food, but don’t see it as an appliance for cooking proper food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really a shame as cooking food in the microwave has many advantages: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tasty&lt;/em&gt;: food cooked in the microwave retains its natural taste and texture.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quick&lt;/em&gt;: generally microwave cooking needs shorter cooking times than other cooking methods.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Healthy&lt;/em&gt;: most food retains &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; nutrients and vitamins when cooked in the microwave, as explained by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/microwave-cooking-and-nutrition&quot;&gt; (see also e.g. [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;#ref3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;#ref4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;#ref5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;]).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eco&lt;/em&gt;: cooking in the microwave is generally more energy-efficient than cooking using a conventional oven or hob: according to a DEFRA study from 2008 &lt;a href=&quot;#ref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, overall, the microwave oven has the lowest greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Versatile&lt;/em&gt;: you have very accurate control over the heating level and cooking time. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Less messy&lt;/em&gt;: cooking in the microwave requires no fat and the food doesn’t stick to the pot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So give the microwave a try for cooking food. It’s really easy. If you’re unsure, have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quickandtastycooking.org.uk/recipes/&quot;&gt;my recipes&lt;/a&gt;. I use the microwave in all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Zen way of cooking</title>
        <link href="http://www.quickandtastycooking.org.uk/articles/zen-cooking/"/>

				</author>
        <content type="html">
        	&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/zencookbook_1600x600.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;There is a famous Zen poem about the right way to make tea (“cha no yu”), and it translates loosely as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--
茶の湯とは、
ただ湯を沸かし
茶を点てて、
飲むばかり
なる本を知るべし
--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“To make tea, just boil water, make tea, then you drink it properly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Zen way of cooking is somewhat similar. Japanese Zen Buddhism has a long tradition of what is called “temple cuisine”, a refined and essentially vegan way of cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was living in Japan, near Kyoto, there was a Zen temple close by, the beautiful Manpukuji.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/manpukuji-1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/manpukuji-2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the shop of the Manpukuji temple I bought this cookbook (in Japanese only) about “fucha ryori” (Zen temple cuisine):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/zencookbook.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Zen temple cookbook&quot; title=&quot;Zen temple cookbook&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is full of delicious-looking pictures of the recipes, like this one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/zencookbook_page.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Page from the zen temple cookbook&quot; title=&quot;Page from the zen temple cookbook&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is very different from a regular cookbook is the way the recipes are described: typically, there is a list of ingredients but no amounts, and the method of cooking is described but usually no cooking times are given. Clearly, these details are not the essence of Zen cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, for every recipe the book mentions if it is for spring, summer, autumn or winter. This connection with the seasons is of great importance in Japan. Also, the the recipes give detailed instructions  related to the way the prepared food looks. The aesthetic aspect is as important as the taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So maybe we can express the Zen way of cooking like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;普茶料理とはただ材料を選び食を作って盛るばかりなる本を知るべし&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“To cook the Zen way, just take the right ingredients, prepare the food, then serve it properly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>The 3 great virtues of a cook: laziness, impatience and hubris</title>

        	&lt;p&gt;Some of the qualities of a geek boffin are transferable to cooking.&lt;a name=&quot;homepage_banner&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;laziness&quot;&gt;Laziness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you create recipes that are easy to make with ingredients that are easy to find. Hence, the first great virtue of a cook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impatience&quot;&gt;Impatience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not wanting to spend ages preparing food. This makes you create recipes that are quick to prepare and quick to cook, with minimal cleaning-up. Hence, the second great virtue of a cook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hubris&quot;&gt;Hubris&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quality that makes you create tasty recipes that the whole world will want to cook. Hence, the third great virtue of a cook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This post is inspired by Larry Wall’s views on the virtues of a programmer in “Programming Perl” (2nd ed.) by Tom Christiansen, Randal L. Schwartz, Larry Wall published by O’Reilly, 1996&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>7 tips for making quick &amp; tasty meals</title>

        	&lt;p&gt;With these tips, making tasty meals will be a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;build-a-core-set-of-recipesa-namehomepagebannera&quot;&gt;Build a core set of recipes&lt;a name=&quot;homepage_banner&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a quick meal it is important that you don’t have to think about it. By having a set of ten to twenty favourite recipes, you can quickly make what you like and have a wide variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-fresh-vegetables-for-taste&quot;&gt;Use fresh vegetables for taste&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is really essential to use fresh vegetables in a meal. Vegetables make the meal balanced; fresh vegetables simply taste so much better than the ones in tins or jars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-overcook&quot;&gt;Don’t overcook&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may sound totally obvious, but cook the food for the shortest possible time. Many vegetables don’t need to be cooked at all. All you want is that they are hot and maybe slightly softened. They will taste at their best too. Overcooking your food takes longer and destroys the taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;add-umami&quot;&gt;Add &lt;em&gt;umami&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Umami&lt;/em&gt; is a loanword from the Japanese which can be translated as “pleasant savory taste”, and it is one of the five basic tastes. Even after adding spices, nuts, etc., you may find the food is still not “tasty” enough. That means you need to add some umami. Ingredients that contain a lot of umami are dried tomatoes, dried mushrooms, hard cheese, miso, soy sauce, seaweed, garlic, and also beans (in particular fresh soy beans).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;think-about-texture&quot;&gt;Think about texture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We appreciate food through more than the taste and smell. The way food feels when you eat it — smooth, crunchy, etc. — is equally important. Vegetables are great for texture, this is another reason not to overcook them. For extra crunch you can add seeds or nuts, for more “bite” dried mushrooms are great, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;make-a-one-pot-meal&quot;&gt;Make a one-pot meal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the difficulty with cooking is having to multitask with several pots on the hob. Making a one-pot main meal is much simpler and quicker, because you have only one thing to attend to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-the-microwave&quot;&gt;Use the microwave&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The microwave oven is much underrated for cooking. It has the advantages of preparing food quickly, preserving more of the nutrients, and it is hassle-free: you don’t have to watch it and there is less cleaning-up afterwards too.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;My aim with Quick and Tasty Cooking is to get more people to cook healthy food and ultimately to write a cookbook and donate the proceeds to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wfp.org/&quot;&gt;UN World Food Programme&lt;/a&gt;. For a publisher to take interest, I need to have many, many followers on Facebook and Twitter. Please help me to achieve this goal by liking my Facebook page or following me on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;inline-btn&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- /.follow-us --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My recipes are quick (really) and easy, don’t require any gadgets and use few ingredients — all of which you can find in the supermarket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All recipes are my own creation, unless credited. I’ll post a new quick &amp;amp; tasty recipe every week.&lt;/p&gt;
