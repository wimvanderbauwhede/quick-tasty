        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/memory-police_1600x600.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;“The Memory Police” (&lt;em&gt;hisoyaka na kesshō&lt;/em&gt;, 密やかな結晶) is a novel from 1994 by Yoko Ogawa, one of Japan’s most renowned writers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s set on an island but the community there is otherwise quite similar to mainland Japan. Things disappear from the community’s life, and people forget about them. They don’t simply disappear. For example, when the “perfume” disappears , people pour out their perfume bottles in the river. Then they forget that perfume ever existed. And when “birds” disappear, people set free their caged birds, and totally forget all about birds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book centres on three characters: the narrator (&lt;em&gt;watashi&lt;/em&gt; わたし, “I”), the old man (&lt;em&gt;ojii-san&lt;/em&gt; おじいさん, &lt;em&gt;jii&lt;/em&gt; is old man and &lt;em&gt;o&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;san&lt;/em&gt; are honorifics) and the narrator’s editor, “R” (&lt;em&gt;R-shi&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;shi&lt;/em&gt; 氏 is a formal form of referring to a person, typically someone one is not close with).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started reading near the end of February and it took me three months to read the novel in Japanese, reading a few pages most evenings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend this book because it is very taught-provoking. Although nothing really bad happens explicitly, it is a very sad story. The book has 28 chapters and the real turning point is by the end of Chapter 25. It’s very beautifully written, with a great eye for small details and remarkable control over specificity: early on, the setting of the story seems very generic but as the book progresses, there are more specific Japanese cultural references; towards the end they disappear again. I really like the way the author expresses e.g. unease of a character by describing how he keeps putting his feet into his slippers and pulling them back out, or the details about the type of shoe that makes a specific sound, so you can tell the wearer is a young woman, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the title in Japanese &lt;em&gt;hisoyaka&lt;/em&gt; means quiet, still, surreptitious; &lt;em&gt;kesshou&lt;/em&gt; means crystal or crystallisation but also fruits of labour etc. So it  is “Quiet crystallisation”. (The French title is “Cristallisation secrète”.) According to the afterword, the Yoko Ogawa was thinking of “crystallised” memories we carry inside us. The English title puts the focus on the Memory Police themselves but they are not the focus of the novel. The problem with the English title is that it leads the reader to expect some totalitarian political novel, which it is not. The memory police serve as a cause for fear because of their control of the population, but that is not the point at all. To my mind, the novel is really about the acceptance of loss. Loss of memories, loss of many good things in life, loss of loved ones, loss of abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- I have been considering the implication of the existence of the Memory Police in the novel (which in Japanese is simply called the　Secret Police, _himitsu keisatsu_ 秘密警察). There seems to be no reason why they should exist. Then I realised that there does not need to be a reason beyond their purpose: those in power have realised that a given situation can be exploited to gain additional control over the population, and created the system to exert that control. That the situation does not require this system is entirely irrelevant. The purpose is control. --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;issues-of-translation-from-japanese&quot;&gt;Issues of translation from Japanese&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am increasingly interested in issues of translation from Japanese.  Reading a Japanese novel does not require full translation, because I don’t need to turn a Japanese sentence into an English  one (or a Dutch one, as that is my native tongue) to understand it. I’ve written a few blog posts on &lt;a href=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/articles/reading-murakami/&quot;&gt;reading Japanese&lt;/a&gt;, especially &lt;a href=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/articles/learning-japanese-reading-murakami/&quot;&gt;as a learner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while reading this novel I did think a lot about how it could be translated. What is peculiar in this novel is that there are hardly any typically Japanese elements. It could be set anywhere. Mentions of food are very unspecific; people drink coffee, black tea or cocoa and sometimes wine. Even terms that could have been specific such as the mention of an altar to the sea gods in an old ferry, are not: the word used is &lt;em&gt;umi no kamisama no saidan&lt;/em&gt; 海の神様の祭壇 rather than the more common Shinto term &lt;em&gt;watatzumi no kamidana&lt;/em&gt; 海神の神棚. 
There are the typically Japanese politeness levels and honorary pre- and suffixes, but if I were to translate it, I would not try to emulate them. Especially the old man is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; polite, and always refers to the narrator as &lt;em&gt;ojousama&lt;/em&gt; お嬢様, a very formal way of saying “Miss”.
The word used for clothes is  &lt;em&gt;youfuku&lt;/em&gt; 洋服, Western clothes, but I feel that is purely for the benefit of the Japanese audience, so I would just translate it as “clothes”.
The climate is definitely not Scotland but not specifically Japan either, nor is the vegetation that is mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it is carefully unspecific, at least in the initial chapters. It made me wonder if there was any benefit at all in reading it in Japanese. The translation is excellent, it was shortlisted for the Booker Prize 2020. And yet, I find the Japanese very beautiful and I think impossible to convey entirely in translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The translator, Stephen Snyder, &lt;a href=&quot;https://shelfmediagroup.com/interview/interview-stephen-snyder-translator-for-the-memory-police-by-yoko-ogawa/&quot;&gt;says in an interview&lt;/a&gt;: “Yoko Ogawa’s prose in Japanese is extraordinarily beautiful, so it’s always a challenge to try to find a way to capture even a vague sense of that beauty in English.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I just like reading Japanese, slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While reading I noted down some typical Japanese cultural elements that caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Indented sentences are quotes. English quotes in italics are from the translation by Stephen Snyder, other translations are mine.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;roses&quot;&gt;Roses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For about the first quarter of the novel, there are no Japan-specific references, but then, in Chapter 6, with the disappearance of the roses, there was one after all: primary school kids with &lt;em&gt;randoseru&lt;/em&gt; ランドセル , firm-sided school backpacks made of leather. A less specific word would have been 学生鞄 &lt;em&gt;gakusei kaban&lt;/em&gt; (school bag). The word &lt;em&gt;randoseru&lt;/em&gt; derives from the Dutch “ransel”; they are very typical for Japanese schoolkids. Still, when I was in primary school in Flanders, I had one too, with a slightly different shape, wider and less deep; we just called it “boekentas” (book bag). I loved the sound the clasps made. And when you ran with it on, the books and pens etc would rattle inside, which is exactly what the writer describes as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The children took off running along the river, their backpacks rattling behind them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;no-italic&quot;&gt;子供たちはランドセルを鳴らしながら、流れを追いかけていった。&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;kodomotachi ha RANDOSERU wo narashinagara, nagare wo oikakete itta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;no-italic&quot;&gt;With rattling school bags, the kids went chasing the flow.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another, perhaps less obvious, cultural reference, occurs at the start of Chapter 7:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At the base of the bridge next to my laundry platform stood an elegantly dressed woman. &lt;br /&gt; “What lovely roses,” I told her.&lt;br /&gt;This was the first thing that came to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;no-italic&quot;&gt;洗濯場にかかる橋のたもとにも、お金持ち風の婦人が一人、たたずんでいた。&lt;br /&gt;「気品のあるバラですね」わたしは言った。&lt;br /&gt;それでふと頭に浮かんだ修飾語を、そのまま口にしたのだった&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;sentakujo ni kakaru hashi no tamoto ni mo, okanemochi fuu no fujin ga hitori, tatazunde ita.&lt;br /&gt;“kihin no aru bara desu ne” watashi ha itta.&lt;br /&gt;sore de futo atama ni ukanda shoushokugo wo, sono mama kuchi ni shita no datta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “What lovely roses” in Japanese is “&lt;em&gt;kihin no aru bara desu ne&lt;/em&gt;” (what elegant roses), and the narrator comments on her random choice of “&lt;em&gt;kihin no aru&lt;/em&gt;”  with the term &lt;em&gt;shoushokugo&lt;/em&gt; 修飾語 which is the general grammatical term for “modifier” (she is after all a novelist). That is because it is an adjectival sentence rather than an adjective (“roses that have elegance”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once her work was done, she turned and, without a glance at the stream, gave me the sort of graceful bow typical of people of her class and left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;no-italic&quot;&gt;すべての作業が終わると婦人は、川の流れを目で追い掛けようともせず、上流階級の人独特のゆったりとしたお辞儀をして、わたしから離れていった。&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;subete no sagyou ga owaru to fujin ha, kawa no nagare wo me de oikake you to mo sezu, jouryuukaikyuu no hito dokutoku no yuttari shita ojigi wo shite, watashi kara hanarete itta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “graceful bow” is a &lt;em&gt;jiki&lt;/em&gt; 辞儀, a bow accompanying a greeting, rather than &lt;em&gt;rei&lt;/em&gt; 礼, a bow to thank someone. The narrator uses the words &lt;em&gt;jouryuukaikyuu no hito&lt;/em&gt; 上流階級の人 (upper class person) and &lt;em&gt;yuttari to shita&lt;/em&gt; ゆったりとした (easy, leisurely) bow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iriko&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iriko&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 8, where R visits the narrator’s mother’s workshop in the basement, the narrator recalls her mother eating &lt;em&gt;iriko&lt;/em&gt; イリコ (also written 炒り子). This is quite specific: the term is only used in the West of Japan (and also in Hawaii, because of immigrants from Western Japan). It refers to Japanese anchovy fry  (&lt;em&gt;kataguchi-iwashi&lt;/em&gt;, 片口鰯), boiled in brine and then dried. In the rest of Japan they are called &lt;em&gt;niboshi&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;jako&lt;/em&gt;. The writer was born in Okayama, Okayama Prefecture in Kansai, so that is probably why she uses the word &lt;em&gt;iriko&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;niboshi&lt;/em&gt;. To translate it in a culturally context-free way, you could of course just say dried anchovies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“My mother always kept dried sardines wrapped in newspaper on the desk in her studio, and she would snack on them as she worked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;no-italic&quot;&gt;「母は仕事場の机に、いつも新聞紙にくるんだイリコを置いていたんです。それをムシャムシャ食べながら仕事をしていたの。」&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;haha ha shigotoba no tsukue ni, itsumo shinbungami ni kurunda IRIKO wo oite itandesu. sore wo MUSHAMUSHA tabenagara shigoto wo shite ita no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-secret-police-does-not-take-prisoners&quot;&gt;The Secret Police does not take prisoners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 13, the narrator is at the head office of the secret police and talking to a kind of receptionist. She says 「差し入れ」 (&lt;em&gt;“sashiire”&lt;/em&gt;) and the person she’s talking to says 「さしいれ？」(&lt;em&gt;“sashiire?”&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word 差し入れ (sashi-ire) has the following meanings:
(1) Insertion, letter drop.
(2) Things sent to a prisoner.
(3) Supply of provisions, refreshments, etc. to someone carrying out a task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the novel the meaning is clearly “Things sent to a prisoner”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subtext is that the receptionist pretends not to understand this word (because of course the secret police does not take &lt;em&gt;prisoners&lt;/em&gt;).
The use of &lt;em&gt;hiragana&lt;/em&gt; for this word normally written in &lt;em&gt;kanji&lt;/em&gt; makes that very clear, but is difficult to bring across in translation: use of italics or quotes do not have quite the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I have a package I’d like to have delivered to an acquaintance…” My voice trailed off, echoing from the ceiling before being lost in the vastness of the hall.&lt;br /&gt;
    “Package?” He paused, twirling his pen in his fingers, and repeated the word as though trying to recall the meaning of some rarely used philosophical term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kanji-and-the-latin-alphabet&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kanji&lt;/em&gt; and the Latin alphabet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second chapter of the novel, the narrator refers to her father’s documents about birds with containing “”鳥”という 字” (&lt;em&gt;“tori” to iu ji&lt;/em&gt;). You can translate that as “the word ‘bird’, but  although &lt;em&gt;ji&lt;/em&gt;  can mean “word”, it usually means “character” and is anyhow more specific than &lt;em&gt;kotoba&lt;/em&gt; (word).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When they came upon something they considered dangerous—in other words, anything that contained the word “bird”—they threw the item unceremoniously on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;no-italic&quot;&gt;危険とみなされたものはーーつまりどこかに一つでも”鳥”という字がみつかったものはーーどんどん床に放り投げられていった。&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;kiken to minasareta mono ha – tsumari nanika hitotsu demo “tori” to iu ji ga mitsukatta mono ha – dondon yuka ni　hourinagerarete itta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the third chapter there is a scene of the narrator writing a novel, and she describes the typical &lt;em&gt;genkouyoushi&lt;/em&gt; 原稿用紙,  i.e “paper for manuscripts”, Japanese writing paper lined with a square grid, one square per character. Of course as a translator you could just say “writing paper”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in Chapter 14 there is a scene where the narrator, still in the HQ of the secret police, mentions specifically that someone is writing using the alphabet (&lt;em&gt;arufabetto&lt;/em&gt; アルファベット ):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;His papers were thickly covered with numbers and letters in a script I did not understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;no-italic&quot;&gt;書類には意味のよく分らない数字やアルファベットが、びっしり書き込んであった。&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;shorui ni ha imi no yoku wakaranai suuji ya ARUFABETTO ga, bisshiri kakikonde atta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I would have translated the earlier kanji-specific terms in a generic way, then I would have to say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;no-italic&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The forms were densely filled in with numbers and letters the meaning of which I didn't understand very well&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas if I had been specific about the earlier writing being in kanji, I could translate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;no-italic&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The forms were densely filled in with numbers and  characters in the latin alphabet, the meaning of which I didn't understand very well&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does not matter much of course, but in the latter case the story would be more clearly set in Japan than in the former.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;onomatopoeic-and-mimetic-words&quot;&gt;Onomatopoeic and mimetic words&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, Japanese has many words with the structure like the word &lt;em&gt;bisshiri&lt;/em&gt; びっしり (densely written) used in that sentence: four &lt;em&gt;hiragana&lt;/em&gt; characters, the second a small &lt;em&gt;tsu&lt;/em&gt; っ which indicates a glottal stop, and the last one &lt;em&gt;ri&lt;/em&gt; り. For example, &lt;em&gt;bikkuri&lt;/em&gt;　(surprised, frightened), &lt;em&gt;tappuri&lt;/em&gt; (plentiful), &lt;em&gt;sappari&lt;/em&gt; (feeling refreshed) etc.　Someone at made an attempt to enumerate them and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www1.kcn.ne.jp/~bamba/tips/XxXX.html&quot;&gt;counted 158 of them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics says that 103 of these words with pattern AっBり are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.ninjal.ac.jp/Onomatope/column/nihongo_2.html&quot;&gt;onomatopoeic and mimetic words&lt;/a&gt;. Japanese has about two thousand of these onomatopoeic and mimetic words; there are many forms but the most common is ABAB (like &lt;em&gt;wakuwaku&lt;/em&gt; わくわく, nervous, trembling, excited; or &lt;em&gt;mushamusha&lt;/em&gt; ムシャムシャ, munching); the pattern ABり (like &lt;em&gt;shikiri&lt;/em&gt; しきり, frequent, continual) is also quite common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoko Ogawa makes liberal use of such words and it is one of the aspects that is hard to convey in translation, especially the mimetic words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Nothing in Chapters 9, 10 , 11, 12? --&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;baumkuchen&quot;&gt;Baumkuchen&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of Chapter 13 is a very specific Japanese cultural reference, the mention of &lt;em&gt;baumukuuhen&lt;/em&gt; バウムクーヘン, “Baumkuchen”. This is a kind of cake of German origin that looks like a cross-section of a tree trunk with a hole in the middle, as it is baked on a spit. It is very popular in Japan. I used to buy them in the &lt;em&gt;konbini&lt;/em&gt; to have with my coffee. And it is specifically popular as a gift to guests at weddings, which is exactly the case in the novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“My parents had come home from the wedding, but neither of them seemed to realize that I’d slept the entire day. They were animated and wanted me to taste the cake they had brought home from the reception.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;no-italic&quot;&gt;「両親が結婚式から帰ってきたんです。二人ともわたしが眠り続けていたことに、気づきもしませんでした。さあ、お土産のバウムクーヘンを食べましょうなんて、うきうきしているだけなんです」&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“ryoushin ga kekkonshiki kara kaette kitandesu. futari tomo watashi ga nemuritsdzukete ita koto ni, kidzuki mo shimasen deshita. saa, omiyage no BAUMUKUUHEN wo tabemashou nante, ukiuki shite iru data nandesu”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If as a translator I wanted to avoid the cultural reference I could replace it by “wedding cake”, and that would at least work in Anglo-Saxon countries. In other countries where guests don’t get to take a piece of cake home (like in Flanders), the text gives me a way out because it refers to the Baumkuchen as &lt;em&gt;omiyage&lt;/em&gt; (お土産, local specialty or souvenir bought as a gift while travelling) so I could simply call it “the local speciality cake” or something similar.　&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole, if I were to translate this novel, I think I would prefer to keep the few Japanese cultural references as they are. It would fit better with other culturally specific elements such as the politeness levels, which it would be rather a shame to remove entirely in translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;loanwords&quot;&gt;Loanwords&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese has a lot of loanwords that are written in &lt;em&gt;katakana&lt;/em&gt;. Most of them are from American English, to the extent that it is a running joke that you can speak Japanese with only &lt;em&gt;katakana&lt;/em&gt;-English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am generally more interested in the &lt;em&gt;katakana&lt;/em&gt; loanwords that are not from English. In this novel there are quite a few. I already mentioned &lt;em&gt;randoseru&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;baumukuuhen&lt;/em&gt;. Other examples are &lt;em&gt;mesu&lt;/em&gt; メス from Dutch “mes” – Japanese meaning “scalpel”, Dutch meaning knife; &lt;em&gt;kokku&lt;/em&gt; コック from Dutch “kok”, “cook”; &lt;em&gt;karute&lt;/em&gt; カルテ from German &lt;em&gt;Karte&lt;/em&gt; – Japanese meaning “clinical record”, German meaning “card”; and &lt;em&gt;noruma&lt;/em&gt; ノルマ from Russian “norma” – Japanese meaning “quota”, Russian meaning “norm”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like such words because they relate to Japan’s history, for example Japan imported the German medical system in the 19th century; the Baumkuchen were created by a German baker, an ex-prisoner-of-war, for the Hiroshima Prefectural Commercial Exhibition in 1919. The Dutch words are even older as they were one of the few nations allowed to trade with Japan in the Tokugawa era (early 1600s), together with the Portuguese from which amongst others パン “pan”, bread was loaned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the novel, the bread is usually ロールパ &lt;em&gt;roorupan&lt;/em&gt; which means “breadroll”, the &lt;em&gt;rooru&lt;/em&gt; (roll) borrowed from English, or &lt;em&gt;furansupan&lt;/em&gt; フランスパン “French bread”. In common Japanese, the most common word is &lt;em&gt;shokupan&lt;/em&gt; 食パン which is typically a white square loaf; &lt;em&gt;shoku&lt;/em&gt; just means “food”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An English loanword that is interesting from a translation perspective is ショートケーキ &lt;em&gt;shootokeeki&lt;/em&gt;, “shortcake”, because this is a typical American cake also popular in Japan. If I were translate this novel into Dutch with Japanese cultural references I would leave it as “shortcake”; but it’s a type of cake not so well known in Flanders so otherwise I would probably use “gâteau” as that is a similar cake for a Flemish audience. (And yes, that is a loanword from French into Flemish.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- That section from Ch 13 is not in the online book?  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Nothning in 15? --&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cherry-blossoms&quot;&gt;Cherry blossoms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there was still any doubt about the Japanese setting of the novel, the following sentence in Chapter 16 puts an end to that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even if we couldn’t recall the exact date, I knew that his came around every year just as the cherry blossoms were budding out. I was quite certain that time was fast approaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;no-italic&quot;&gt;日付けは思い出せなくても、毎年桜がわずかに開き始める季節だったことは確かで、
そろそろそういう時期が近づいてきたという予感は間違いなくするのだった。&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;nittsuke ha omoidasenakute, mainen sakura ga wazuka ni hirakihajimeru kisetsu datta koto ha tashika de, sorosoro sou iu jiki ga chikadzuite kita tou iu yokan ha machigainaku suru no datta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;no-italic&quot;&gt;Even though I couldn't remember the date anymore, it was certainly around the time when every year the cherry blossoms just started to open, and I had the unmistakeable premonition that that season was soon drawing near.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;sakura&lt;/em&gt;, cherry blossoms, are quintessentially Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;music-box&quot;&gt;Music box&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 16, another nice loanword appears, again from Dutch: &lt;em&gt;orugooru&lt;/em&gt; オルゴール  from “orgel”, meaning music box. The word “orgel” literally means organ. The mechanism for music boxes were initially based on the barrel organ, “draaiorgel” in Dutch. According to Kotobank, the first mention in Japanese is in a publication from 1750.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene where this &lt;em&gt;orugooru&lt;/em&gt; is introduced is one of my favourite scenes in the novel. Such a nice description of the emotions that listening to the melody played by a music box evokes. It is all the more poignant because the narrotor and the old man have no memory of music boxes anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the two Japanese words kept in the English translation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It’s not really magic,” R said. “It’s an orugooru.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;no-italic&quot;&gt;「魔術だなて大げさなものじゃありません。これはオルゴールです」R氏が言った。&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“majutsu da nante oogesa na mono ja arimasen. kore ha ORUGOORU desu” R-shi ga itta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yamato-and-wa&quot;&gt;Yamato and &lt;em&gt;wa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 19, there is an explicit reference to Japan:  &lt;em&gt;washitsu&lt;/em&gt; 和室, Japanese-style room. The character 和 (&lt;em&gt;wa&lt;/em&gt;) means both harmony, peace and Japan, Japanese-style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I offered them the Japanese-style room on the first floor, as far as possible from the hidden room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;no-italic&quot;&gt;もちろんわたしは一階の和室ーー隠し部屋から一番遠い部屋ーーを提供してあげた。&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;mochiron watashi ha ikkai no washitsu – kakushiheya kara ichiban tooi heya – wo teikyou ageta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story behind the use of this character to mean Japan is quite interesting. Long ago, Japan was called Yamato. Originally, that was a region in what is now Nara prefecture, where the first capital was. Eventually it came to mean all of Japan. (Later it came to be called Nihon (日本) but that’s another story; as is why it’s called “Japan” in English.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the 3th century CE,  the Japanese adopted the Chinese writing system and until the 7th century, “Yamato” was written 倭,  the character the Chinese had been using for a long time to refer to the inhabitants of the  Japanese islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I explained earlier, most kanji have two types of readings, “onyomi”, which is based on the Japanese rendition of the ancient Chinese pronunciation of a character, and kunyomi, which is the native Japanese reading. The kunyomi for 倭　is &lt;em&gt;yamato&lt;/em&gt;; the onyomi is &lt;em&gt;wa&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then at the start of the Nara period, in 713 CE, the empress Genmei decreed that Yamato (and in fact all important place names) should be written with two “auspicious characters”. Therefore 倭 was prefixed with the character 大, “great”. So it became 大倭,  pronounced in full Ooyamato but usually just Yamato.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, for reasons lost in time, later in the Nara period, 倭 became replaced with 和 which has the same onyomi (&lt;em&gt;wa&lt;/em&gt;), but also means “peace, harmony”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both writings coexisted for a long time but eventually 大和 became the preferred writing. And so now 和 &lt;em&gt;wa&lt;/em&gt; is used to mean “Japanese”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;writing-practice&quot;&gt;Writing practice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 20, the narrator writes out a series of characters. The sequence she writes is the first two rows of the standard organisation for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana#Writing_system&quot;&gt;the Japanese syllabary&lt;/a&gt;, a table with ten rows and five columns, one colum for each vowel sound and one row for each starting consonant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To warm up my fingers, I tried writing a, i, u, e, o. Then, taking care to match the size of the characters to the lines on the paper, I continued with ka, ki, ku, ke, ko.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;no-italic&quot;&gt;指慣らしのために最初、あ、い、う、え、お、と書いて見る。ますめと字の大きさのバランスを確かめながら、か、き、く、け、こと続ける。&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;yubinarashi no tame ni sasho, a, i, u, e, o to kaite miru. masume to ji no ookisa no BARANSU wo tashikamenagara, ka, ki, ku, ke, ko to tsudzukeru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word &lt;em&gt;masume&lt;/em&gt; means a square on Japanese manuscript paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-childrens-game-and-candy&quot;&gt;A childrens’ game and candy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the later chapters, there are more specifically Japanese references, for example in Chapter 22, there is a mention of おはじき &lt;em&gt;ohajiki&lt;/em&gt;, a traditional Japanese children’s game similar to marbles, played with coin-shaped pieces made of coloured glass or plastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So I sounded out the children’s songs my nurse had taught me or the tune we had used to count for tiddlywinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;no-italic&quot;&gt;仕方ないで、昔ばあやさんが歌ってくれた子守歌や、おはじきの数え歌をただただしく吹いた。&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;shikatanai de, mukashi baayasan ga utatte kureta komoriuta ya, ohajiki no kazoeuta wo tadatadashiku fuita.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a mention of　&lt;em&gt;ramune&lt;/em&gt; ラムネ, fizzy soda candy, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.morinaga.co.jp/ramune/&quot;&gt;typical Japanese type of candy&lt;/a&gt;. This is the only other place in the novel where the translator has kept a Japanese word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Is it medicine?” I asked. &lt;br /&gt; “No, it’s called &lt;em&gt;ramune&lt;/em&gt;. I’m impressed that your mother tried to preserve something as ordinary as this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;no-italic&quot;&gt;「何かの薬かしら」わたしは言った。&lt;br /&gt;
「いいや。ラムネだよ。君のお母さんはこんなささやかな物まで、大事に取っていたんだね」&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“nanika no kusuri kashira” watashi ha itta.&lt;br /&gt;“iiya. RAMUNE da yo. kimi no okaasan ha konna sasayaka no mono made, daiji ni totteitanda ne”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And further:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It’s a lemon-flavored candy. When we were children, all the stores sold them and there were countless &lt;em&gt;ramune&lt;/em&gt; on the island, but now there are only these few left here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;no-italic&quot;&gt;「砂糖菓子さ。子供の頃はお店にいくらでも売っていた。島中には数えきれないくらいのラムネがあった。でも今残っているのは、ここにある数粒だけだ」&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“satoukashi sa. kodomo no goro ha omise ni ikurademo utteita. touchuu ni ha kazoekirenaikurai no RAMUNE ga atta. demo ima nokotte iru no ha, koko ni aru suutsubu dake da”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese word &lt;em&gt;satoukashi&lt;/em&gt; 砂糖菓子 means simply “sugar candy”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trains&quot;&gt;Trains&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 23 features a train journey. Train is normally  &lt;em&gt;densha&lt;/em&gt; 電車 which literally means “electric vehicle”, but the novel always uses &lt;em&gt;kisha&lt;/em&gt; 汽車 “train, esp. long distance, but originally steam train” (&lt;em&gt;ki&lt;/em&gt; means steam). And as it mentions a whistle, I think it is actually a steam train.&lt;br /&gt;
The other word used is  &lt;em&gt;ressha&lt;/em&gt; 列車 the term for “train” used by the railway companies; &lt;em&gt;retsu&lt;/em&gt; means “file”, so it is literally a file of cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are mentions of several types trains:  &lt;em&gt;kyuukou&lt;/em&gt; 急行 “express” and  &lt;em&gt;tokkyuu&lt;/em&gt; 特急 “limited express” (faster than an express) and also of the  &lt;em&gt;kaisatsuguchi&lt;/em&gt; 改札口, ticket gates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trains are of course universal but this terminology is quite specific to the Japanese railway system. Also, for me personally, it evokes memories of taking the train in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-hands-of-the-old-man-made-many-things&quot;&gt;The hands of the old man made many things&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 24 there is a beautiful description of the hands of the old man, with a list of objects his hands had made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have always loved his hands, from the time I was a little girl. They could make almost anything: a toy box, a plastic model, a cage for a rhinoceros beetle, a beanbag, a desk lamp, a bicycle seat cover, smoked fish, an apple cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;no-italic&quot;&gt;子供の頃から、わたしはおじいさんの手が大好きだった。みんなで一緒に出掛ける時は、いつでもおじいさんと手をつないだ。それはおもちゃ箱や、自動車のプラモデルや、カブト虫の飼育箱や、お手玉や、電気スタンドや、自転車のサドルカバーや、魚の燻製や、リンゴケーキや、とにかく何でも作り出すことができる。&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;kodomo no goro kara, watashi ha ojiisan no te ga suki datta. minna de issho ni dekakeru toki ha, itsudemo ojiisan no te wo tusnaida. sore ha omochabako, jidousha no PURAMODERU ya, KABUTOmushi no shiikubako ya, otedama ya, deki SUTANDO ya, jitensha no SADORUKABAA ya, sakana no kunsei ya, RINGOKEEKI ya, tonikaku nandemo tsukuridasu koto ga dekiru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these are very typical: カブト虫の飼育箱 &lt;em&gt;kabutomushi no shiikubako&lt;/em&gt;,  a cage for rearing a Japanese rhinoceros beetle;　お手玉 &lt;em&gt;otedama&lt;/em&gt;  (translated above as “beanbag”) are &lt;a href=&quot;https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%8A%E6%89%8B%E7%8E%89&quot;&gt;balls of colourful fabric filled with rice or beans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a small phrase left untranslated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;no-italic&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;みんなで一緒に出掛ける時は、いつでもおじいさんと手をつないだ。&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;minna de issho ni dekakeru toki ha, itsudemo ojiisan no te wo tusnaida&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;no-italic&quot;&gt;When we all went out together, I was always holding the old man's hand.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t work so well in English because for the narrator, &lt;em&gt;ojiisan&lt;/em&gt; is a term of endearment, and “the old man” does not carry that connotation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, there are very few explicit Japanese cultural references in the original novel, only about one for every two chapters. It’s interesting to see that the English translation keeps enough of them that the Japanese setting of the novel is still clear to the attentive reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The banner picture shows green tea Baumkuchen in a shop in Kyoto.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/parsnip-pizza_1600.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;This is a traditional thin-crust pizza with a non-traditional topping: parsnips seasoned with tomato purée, tobanjan and garlic oil. It is easy to make but takes some time as the dough has to rise for two hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fermented broad bean paste (called &lt;em&gt;doubanjiang&lt;/em&gt; in Chinese, &lt;em&gt;tobanjan&lt;/em&gt; in Japanese) is a key ingredient, as it adds both umami and spicyness to the parsnips. Make sure to check the ingredients as there are many types of chilli bean paste and a lot of them are not vegetarian. The Chinese characters are 豆瓣酱. If it says 辛豆瓣酱 then it will be very spicy. The brand I got is Pearl River Bridge Chilli Bean Paste.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What I call tomato purée is called tomato paste in the US.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;post-tag&quot; href=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/tags/#vegetarian&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;vegetarian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  • &lt;em&gt;600 kcal per person&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/tags/#400-600kcals&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/battery_lvl_2.png&quot; style=&quot;height:1.0em;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For two people:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for the base
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;130 g white flour (I use half “00” pasta flour and half bread flour)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;80 ml water&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;7 g dried yeast&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;2 g salt&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for the toppings
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;1 pack (250 g) of mozarella slices&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;200 g parsnips&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;100 g chestnut mushrooms&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;a handful of dried funghi porcini&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;50 g grated parmezan or grana padano&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons pine nuts&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon tomato purée&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon garlic oil&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;1/2 teaspoon tobanjan&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preparation&quot;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;making-the-dough&quot;&gt;Making the dough&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put all ingredients in a pot and mix them, then knead until you have a smooth dough.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let the dough rest, covered, for one hour.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knead the though gently for a second time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let it rest, covered, for another hour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;the-toppings&quot;&gt;The toppings&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soak the porcini mushrooms for 30 minutes in freshly boiled water.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wash and peel the parsnips and slice them as thinly as possibly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cook the parsnips in the microwave at 900 W for 3 minutes 30 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put the cooking liquid in a broad, shallow bowl and add the tomato puree, garlic oil and tobanjan. Mix into a smooth paste.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add the cooked parsnips and mix so they are evenly covered with the seasoning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Slice the mushrooms as thinly as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;making-the-pizza&quot;&gt;Making the pizza&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I make a rectangular pizza on a baking tray covered with baking paper.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I don’t use a rolling pin but flatten the dough by pushing with my fingers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preheat the oven at 250 ºC.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When the pizza base is ready, cover it with the mozarella slices, parsnips and mushrooms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have a hot air oven so I bake the pizza for 5 minutes, then turn, then bake it for another 5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take the pizza out of the oven.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add the porcini mushrooms, pine kernels and grated hard cheese.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put the pizza back in the oven and bake for another 3 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>The mystery of the giant Kannon statues</title>

        <updated>2021-05-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated>

        <content type="html">
        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/kannon_1600x600.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;Some time ago I stumbled across an intriguing random fact: of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_statues&quot;&gt;fifty tallest statues in the world&lt;/a&gt;, fourteen are of the Buddha but eighteen are of a being called &lt;em&gt;Kannon&lt;/em&gt; in Japanese (&lt;em&gt;Guanyin&lt;/em&gt; in Chinese). Thirteen of these tallest statues are in Japan and twelve of these are  Kannon statues (the other is a statue of the Buddha).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So who is this Kannon, and why are some many of the tall statues of it, in particular in Japan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, there is little mystery in the tall statues themselves. They are almost invariably built either as tourist attractions or as war memorials. What is more interesting though is why so many of them represent the Kannon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;buddha-and-bodhisattva&quot;&gt;Buddha and Bodhisattva&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buddhism originated in India sometime between the sixth and fourth century BCE, and spread to Japan via China in the first half of the sixth century CE. By that time, it had already developed a long tradition and forked into several branches. There are three major  schools of Buddhism: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.namchak.org/community/blog/three-different-paths-theravada-mahayana-and-vajrayana/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theravada&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mahāyāna&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Vajrayana&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general in Buddhism, a &lt;em&gt;bodhisattva&lt;/em&gt; (a sentient being, &lt;em&gt;sattva&lt;/em&gt; , that develops enlightenment, &lt;em&gt;bodhi&lt;/em&gt;) is any person who is on the path towards Buddhahood. Specifically in Mahāyāna Buddhism, a bodhisattva refers to anyone who has developed a mind that strives toward awakening (attaining Buddhahood), empathy, and compassion for the benefit of all sentient beings. (This is known as &lt;em&gt;bodhicitta&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kannon&quot;&gt;Kannon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Japanese, &lt;em&gt;bodhisattva&lt;/em&gt; are know as &lt;em&gt;bosatsu&lt;/em&gt; (菩薩). One &lt;em&gt;bosatsu&lt;/em&gt; that is especially popular is &lt;em&gt;Kannon&lt;/em&gt; (観音). The word is a contraction of &lt;em&gt;Kanzeon&lt;/em&gt; (観世音), which in its turn is the most commonly used translation of the bodhisattva known in Sanskrit as &lt;em&gt;Avalokiteśvara&lt;/em&gt;. Kannon is the bodhisattva associated with compassion. The name means “[The One Who] Perceives (観) the Sounds (音) of the World (世).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sanskrit term was originally &lt;em&gt;Avalokitasvara&lt;/em&gt; with the ending &lt;em&gt;svara&lt;/em&gt; (“sound, noise”), which means “sound perceiver”, literally “he who looks down upon sound” (i.e., the cries of sentient beings who need his help).  Over time, the name changed to Avalokiteśvara. The ending &lt;em&gt;īśvara&lt;/em&gt; means “lord”, so the meaning became “lord who gazes down (at the world)”, but &lt;em&gt;kannon&lt;/em&gt; retains the original meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bodhisattva is also referred to as Padmapāṇi (“Holder of the Lotus”) or Lokeśvara (“Lord of the World”). In Tibetan, Avalokiteśvara is known as Chenrézig and the Dalai Lama is considered the reincarnation of Chenrézig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, Kannon is the bodhisattva of infinite compassion who gazes down at the human world,
hears all the cries of suffering, and works tirelessly to help those who call upon its name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gender of Kannon is rather vague (I will explain that below) so in what follows I will use the pronouns “they/them” to refer to Kannon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;buddhism-in-japan&quot;&gt;Buddhism in Japan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of Japan, Japanese Buddhism is usually associated with Zen Buddhism, but there are many different Buddhist sects in Japan, and Zen sects are actually a minority.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tofugu.com/japan/japanese-buddhism/&quot;&gt;This Tofugu article&lt;/a&gt; gives a good overview. The dominant form of Buddhism in Japan is Mahāyāna: of the main thirteen sects, eleven are Mahāyāna, including the three Zen sects; only the Ritsu (Theravāda) and Shingon (Vajrayana) sects are not Mahāyāna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Mahāyāna (and Vajrayana) Buddhism, several Buddhas are venerated that are not found in early Buddhism or in Theravada Buddhism. They are considered to be living in other realms, known as “Pure Lands” (&lt;em&gt;Jōdo&lt;/em&gt; 浄土), and are sometimes called “celestial Buddhas” as they are not of this earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important of these is Amitābha (&lt;em&gt;Amida&lt;/em&gt; 阿弥陀, “Buddha of Infinite Light”). This is the principal deity of worship for the Pure Land Buddhist sect and sects that derive from this tradition. Kannon is a spiritual emanation of Amida Buddha and therefore occupies a major place in the pantheon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kannon is mentioned in numerous Mahāyāna sutra (religious texts), but especially in Chapter 25 of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://buddhasutra.com/files/lotus_sutra.htm&quot;&gt;Lotus Sutra&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Hokekyō&lt;/em&gt; 法華経). Because they are the bodhisattva of  of infinite compassion, they became the favourite deity.
Today, Kannon worship is very widespread and essentially non-denominational. Their statues are everywhere, and there are hundreds of pilgrimage routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gender&quot;&gt;Gender&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://buddhasutra.com/files/lotus_sutra.htm&quot;&gt;Lotus Sutra&lt;/a&gt; describes Avalokiteśvara (Kannon) as a bodhisattva who can take the form of any type of god, any type of Buddha, as well as any gender, adult or child, human or non-human being, in order to teach the Dharma to sentient beings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avalokiteśvara was originally depicted as a male bodhisattva and sometimes even has a light moustache. Although this depiction still exists, in modern times Kannon is more often depicted as a woman or as an  androgynous figure. According to the doctrines of the Mahāyāna sūtras themselves, it does not matter whether Kannon is male, female, or genderless, as the ultimate reality is in emptiness (&lt;em&gt;kū&lt;/em&gt; 空, śūnyatā).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;manifestations&quot;&gt;Manifestations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A total of 33 different manifestations of Kannon are described in Chapter 25 of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://buddhasutra.com/files/lotus_sutra.htm&quot;&gt;Lotus Sutra&lt;/a&gt; depending on whatever a living being needs to be saved. One might think that 33 different forms would be plenty. However, when we look at the Kannon statues, we find that some are indeed part of these 33:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Byakue Kannon (白衣観音, White-robed Kannon), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/b/byakuekannon.htm&quot;&gt;“A persistent femininity clings to this kannon even though the figure is shown as a male.”&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;The Ryōzen Kannon 霊山観音 of Kyoto, a Byakue Kannon.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Guze (救世 , salvation or Shou 聖, holy), a male Kannon. The most famous Guze Kannon statue can be found in the Hōryū-ji Temple (法隆寺) in Nara. It was made in the image of prince Shōtoku Taishi (聖徳太子), the first great patron of Buddhism in Japan, in the early 7th Century. Many statues are copies of this one.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gyouran (魚籃, Kannon carrying a fish basket), a female Kannon. There is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mindvalley.com/fish-basket/&quot;&gt;interesting story about this kannon&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=&quot;http://buddhasutra.com/stories/origin_fish_basket_holding_guanyin.htm&quot;&gt;the same story as a comic&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideal.accelerate-ed.com/pub/a/em/-/lo/cebf7683-740a-4f67-8ba8-921ac4fd4cb2/p/40ed4d52-d4aa-467d-8ef9-37bc4279321b&quot;&gt;another nice one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are also some that are not part of the 33 canonical ones:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jibō Kannon (慈母, loving mother), a female Kannon holding a baby, patron of motherhood ans children (&lt;em&gt;koyasu&lt;/em&gt; 子安), and both protect the souls of aborted or stillborn children (&lt;em&gt;mizuko&lt;/em&gt; 水子). Despite not being in the canon, this is a very popular Kannon.

&lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heiwa Kannon (平和 eternal piece), usually male or androgynous, to to pray for world peace and commemorate the war dead. Most of these were built in the 1950s but an interesting example from 1997 is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://impressionsofeastasia.com/2013/04/16/the-unfortunate-history-of-the-whiplash-kannon-and-heiwakannon-ji/&quot;&gt;Awaji Heiwa Kannon&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the Kannon dedicated to world piece are Byakue, like the Ryōzen Kannon above and the Ofuna Kannon in Kamakura.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maria Kannon (マリア観音, Virgin Mary), a female Kannon. Christianity was banned in Japan during the Tokugawa Era (1615-1867). In the 17th century, the Japanese crypto-Christians created statues of the Virgin Mary disguised as Kannon. These effigies, called Maria Kannon, looked like Jibō Kannon but they were venerated by the Christians silently praying to Mother Mary. Many of the statues had a Christian icon hidden inside the body or in the artwork.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/umimachi-diary_1600x600.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;I made a series of four portraits based on a scene from the 2015 movie “海街 diary” (&lt;em&gt;umimachi diary&lt;/em&gt;) by Hirokazu Kore-Eda, called “Our Little Sister” in English. The movie is based on a manga from 2007 of the same name by Akimi Yoshida (吉田秋生) &lt;a href=&quot;https://flowers.shogakukan.co.jp/work/317/&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. The title means “diary of a seaside town”.  The seaside town in the story is Kamakura  (鎌倉市), an ancient capital of Japan on the Pacific coast. The banner picture shows a view over the town which I took in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Akimi Yoshida for the first chapter of her manga Umimachi Diary&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The manga and film tell the story of four sisters: after the funeral of their estranged father, the three Koda sisters Sachi, Yoshino and Chika invite their younger half-sister Suzu to come and live with them at the old family home they share in Kamakura. The film covers a year in Suzu’s life and the portraits are from a scene in summer at the end of that year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film is not so much about the sisters as about how things change with the passage of time, and that passage of time is beautifully suggested in the manga as well as in the movie through subtle references to the seasons. The story starts out in late summer (late August or early September) with the sound of the cicadas: the manga’s first chapter is called  &lt;em&gt;semijigure no yamu koro&lt;/em&gt; (蝉時雨のやむ頃) which means “the time when the chorus of the cicadas stops” (&lt;em&gt;semi&lt;/em&gt; means cicada and &lt;em&gt;jigure&lt;/em&gt; is literally “rain shower”). Suzu moves in with the sisters after the traditional &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Chuin.html&quot;&gt;Buddhist 49-day period of mourning (&lt;em&gt;chuin&lt;/em&gt;, 中陰)&lt;/a&gt; for her father’s death, so by then it is early autumn. A bit later, when she joins the local soccer team, the colourful maple leaves (&lt;em&gt;kouyou&lt;/em&gt;, 紅葉) show us it’s late autumn, and later yet the sisters are huddled around the &lt;em&gt;kotatsu&lt;/em&gt; (a low table with an electric heater attached underneath) in the deep of winter. Then the cherry blossoms (&lt;em&gt;sakurabana&lt;/em&gt;, 桜花) herald spring, and the hydrangeas mark the rainy season (&lt;em&gt;tsuyu&lt;/em&gt;, 梅雨). At the end of this, the sisters pick the green plums from the plum tree in the garden to make plum wine, and then summer comes, with the fireworks (&lt;em&gt;hanabi&lt;/em&gt;, 花火).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene I have chosen for the portraits is when the sisters are having their own fireworks in their garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/scene-for-portraits.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Four young women in yukata, holding sparklers.&quot; title=&quot;Four young women in yukata, holding sparklers.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The senkō hanabi scene from the movie &quot;Our Little Sister&quot;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like it because they are all absorbed in the sparklers; because of the yukatas (summer kimonos) they are wearing for the occasion, which give the scene a timeless quality and provide interesting graphical patterns; and because of the reflection of the light from the sparklers on their faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sparklers are called &lt;em&gt;senkō hanabi&lt;/em&gt; (線香花火, literally “incense-stick fireworks”). They date back to the Edo period (17th century) and are quite sophisticated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Well manufactured senkō hanabi are renowned for having 5 phases in the course of its life: birth, infancy, youth, middle age, and old age. In the birth phase, the firework composition burns to leave a wire-like cinder. In the infancy phase, the cinder gradually shrinks and produces a fireball that increases in brilliancy. The youth phase then displays large pine needle shaped sparks that project from the surface of the fireball. Next, in the middle age phase, many small sparks are emitted from the fireball. Then finally, energy fades in the old age phase as the sparks die down and become willow-like.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268805446_Japanese_Fireworks_Hanabi_The_Ephemeral_Nature_and_Symbolism&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That same paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268805446_Japanese_Fireworks_Hanabi_The_Ephemeral_Nature_and_Symbolism&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; makes the following observation on watching &lt;em&gt;senkō hanabi&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Watching senkō hanabi is like a meditation, mesmerising and calming, allowing thoughts and earthly worries to be temporarily cast aside. Although senkō hanabi only lasts approximately 20 seconds, its brief existence manages to express the sentiment and emotion of an entire life. As the senkō hanabi briefly transitions through each phase, comparisons can accordingly be drawn to the various transitions of one’s own life. The observer is reminded of the rapid change and development in birth and infancy; the vivacious energy of youth; refinement in middle age; and finally, withering in old age. Moreover, the irregular nature of the sparks stresses the randomness and uncertainty of life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my portraits the senkō hanabi is not visible but I wanted to capture the meditative atmosphere of the scene. When I make a portrait I want it to be as close to the photograph I start from but at the same time to reflect the subject’s character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the &lt;em&gt;senkō hanabi&lt;/em&gt; scene to make four individual portraits. The reference picture is quite small, however: if it was printed each part corresponding to a portrait would measure about 5 cm x 7 cm. The drawings are on paper of 38 cm x 56 cm. Scaling up from such a small photograph is one of the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore,  I like to use cold pressed watercolour paper, in this case Arches 300 g/m². This kind of paper has a very coarse grain. It contributes a lot to the texture of the final work, but on the other hand, the coarse grain imposes a limit on the precision with which details can be drawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I prefer to use Conté pencils, because they have a much richer, blacker tint than ordinary pencils. But they have a thick, brittle lead that can’t be sharpened to a fine point. Also, Conté pencil strokes can’t be erased. So once they have been drawn they are part of the drawing, right or not. Because of all this, the final outcome of the drawing is not entirely under my control, and I like it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first portrait, that of Yoshino, I used only Conté pencil and Faber-Castell Graphite Aquarelle pencils, and I washed the drawing to get a deeper black. I was not entirely happy with it, mostly because of the texture of the hair and the background, although the highlights on the face had turned out the way I wanted them and I was pleased with the ginkho pattern on the yukata as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;First portrait of Yoshino&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the portrait of Sachi, I used essentially the same approach but I decided to add a touch of blue colour to the &lt;em&gt;yukata&lt;/em&gt; and use it for highlights as well. I used a Derwent Inktense watercolour pencil for this. Compared to other watercolour pencils, these give a much more intense colour. I rendered the background differently, more abstracted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/p2-sachi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Conté pencil portrait of a Japanese woman in three-quarter, looking down at something in front of her.

&lt;figcaption&gt;Portrait of Sachi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the portrait of Suzu, I used pale pink and blue for the pattern of the yukata, and a slightly more magenta-like colour for the obi (sash), for highlights on the face and for the hairband.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Portrait of Suzu&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final portrait was that of Chika, and it was a bit more challenging because it is very dark and also more cropped than I wanted it for my composition, so I had to extend the right part of it. I again used the same blue with just a few accents of the pink. It is the most abstracted of the four portraits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/p4-chika.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawing of a torso at a three-quarters angle of a young Japanese girl in a yukata with stylised motif of flowers. The yukata is tinted blue with watercolour, the flowers are white with a pink accent. The person is looking down at something in front of her. Her hair is tied up on top with a hair elastic with two white ponpons with some pink. The background is dark.&quot; title=&quot;Drawing of a torso at a three-quarters angle of a young Japanese girl in a yukata with stylised motif of flowers.

&lt;figcaption&gt;Portrait of Chika&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When these three portraits were done, I was no longer satisfied with the first one of Yoshino so I redid it. The composition is different, with the figure much larger, and I changed the position of the torso so that more of the yukata is visible. I used the same Derwent Inktense blue as for the other portraits on the yukata, and the same style of background treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/per-tiziana_1600x600.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;Eidon wrote a beautiful short piece called &lt;a href=&quot;https://noblogo.org/eidon/per-tiziana&quot;&gt;“per Tiziana”&lt;/a&gt;, with two different arrangements. Listening to these two quite different versions, I wondered if I could make a third arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is again a twin post, the other version is &lt;a href=&quot;https://noblogo.org/eidon/per-tiziana-take-ii&quot;&gt;on Eidon’s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;eidon-says&quot;&gt;Eidon says:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Conjure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is an interesting word. It comes from Latin, from “&lt;em&gt;cum iurare&lt;/em&gt;”, which can be translated back as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etymonline.com/word/conjure&quot;&gt;“command on oath” (late 13c.) or “summon by a sacred name” (c. 1300)&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, my experience with composing music is often one of inverted conjuring. Inverted because I do not conjure anything – it is &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; that am commanded, in fact; and the sacred name, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://noblogo.org/i-miei-piccoli-grundgestalt/buddismo-esoterico-e-grundgestalt&quot;&gt;kotodama&lt;/a&gt; if you like that puts me in motion and turns me into its servant, is the music theme that visits me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is what happened with “Per Tiziana” too. Its theme came to me and made me swear that I would serve her well. In practice, this meant that, for days and days and days, the theme of “Per Tiziana” stayed with me all the time. Although I was doing other things, the background (and often the foreground) thoughts were “per Tiziana”. In retrospective, rather than composing it, I was trying to remember it – reconstruct it…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple times I tried to put it down and found myself thinking: “That’s not it”.  When I finally got it (to some extent) right, I found that its decoration with other voices would take me much less than I had expected. Flute, vibraphone, alto sax, cellos, pizzicato strings, timpani, drums, and electric guitar were my initial choices. You can listen to the result &lt;a href=&quot;https://eidon.bandcamp.com/track/per-tiziana&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
I also produced &lt;a href=&quot;https://eidon.bandcamp.com/track/per-tiziana-piano-version&quot;&gt;a second take&lt;/a&gt;, only based on piano, timpani, and drums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes I was happy with the result! I thought to myself, “This is the track that best represents me thus far”. So much so that, even after the finishing touches, I found myself still “conjured” by this track: I could still not think of anything else but her…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But dear friend Wim came to my rescue and released me from my oath! He had liked “Per Tiziana” and told me that he had a new instrumentation in mind. I was very happy of this – Wim has a special gift for instrumentations, and that was also a way to sign my contract off with that piece, in a sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh my god, by any chance did I pass on the conjuring?! I’ve just realized that! Ouch, not so nice of me…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so Wim took over. For some reason, I had expected an instrumentation with classical music instruments, though Wim truly surprised me with something radically different.  And I liked it very, very much! The new manifestation truly resonated with me, and I’m very happy of this wonderful present that Wim had for me. Thank you very much, Wim ^__^&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When listening to the new instrumentation I realized that I wanted to have an extra final note to the piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope one day we may truly write a piece together from beginning to end: maybe a new piece for our &lt;a href=&quot;https://funkwhale.it/library/artists/116/&quot;&gt;Wim and Eidon&lt;/a&gt; album!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wim-says&quot;&gt;Wim says:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;“My&lt;/span&gt; original idea was to try and merge both of Eidon’s versions into something new. But when I listened very carefully to both versions, I realised that wouldn’t work. Each in its own way was already complete. So I had to try and create an entirely different arrangement.
I started from the original arrangement which as Eidon explained has six voices: vibraphone, two cellos, electric guitar, timpani and drums. Eidon kindly provided the &lt;a href=&quot;https://musescore.org/&quot;&gt;MuseScore&lt;/a&gt; files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Eidon has guessed, my first attempt was an orchestral version, because I am comfortable with that: strings, cellos, bass, a clarinet for the main melody, orchestral percussion. It was easy to do and the result sounds nice enough but it did to my ears not really “work”. One issue is the note duration and range which are not a perfect fit for the string instruments. The other is more fundamental: the complex drum pattern in the second part of the piece simply does not work with a symphonic arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This got me to think about the percussion. Because it is a repetitive pattern, I wondered if it would sound good on a drum machine. For some reason – I guess by association with the band 808 State – I thought specifically of the Roland TR-808. That lead to the idea of using old synthesisers for the other voices as well. I experimented with a few and at a certain point I literally laughed out loud because the combination I hit upon worked so beautifully!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shared a first cut with Eidon and he suggested to bring out one of the voices more. I had also commented on the note duration and he explained that the initial instrument he had chosen was a vibraphone that had large preset values for sustain/reverb. I also was not satisfied with my choice of instrument for the timpani voice, and the volume of the drumset voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My final arrangement is as follows: polysynth for the lead voice, synth bass 1 and 3, Moog pad, Roland Brightness from &lt;a href=&quot;http://rkhive.com&quot;&gt;RKHive&lt;/a&gt; for the timpani and the TR-808 drum machine. I changed made the last note in each phrase of the main melody longer and simplified the electric guitar score a bit so that it sounded more natural for the Moog pad. I kept the percussion volume relatively low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eidon did a final tweak, adding an extra note to complete the piece, and we’re both very happy with the result. I really enjoy making these alternative arrangements of Eidon’s work, so really it is I who should thank him for creating these wonderful pieces.
“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the finished track. We hope you like it!&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfeKeQ2fhmA&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ukifune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (浮舟) is a song from 2002 by the Japanese band &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GO!GO!7188&quot;&gt;GO!GO!7188&lt;/a&gt; and one of my all-time favourites. It is a song about broken love, with very poetic lyrics inspired by story from very long ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;春の匂いも芽吹く花も
立ちすくむあたしに君を連れてはこない&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;haru no nioi mo mefuku hana mo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;tachisukumu atashi ni kimi wo tsurete wa konai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When spring comes, I’ll still be frozen and the scents and budding flowers won’t bring you back to me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;夏が来る頃は明け方の雨
静かに寄り添って　かけら拾い集める&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;natsu ga kuru koro wa akegata no ame&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;shizuka ni yorisotte kakera hiroiatsumeru&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When summer comes, the rain at dawn.&lt;br /&gt; 
Snuggling quietly, I gather up the fragments”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;秋が過ぎたらきっとあたしは
のびた黒い髪を切り落としてしまう&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;aki ga sugitara kitto atashi wa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;nobita kuroi kami wo kiriotoshite shimau&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When autumn is gone I’m sure I will&lt;br /&gt; 
finally cut off my long black hair.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;愛しい人よ離れ顔なんて　3日もすりゃすぐに忘れてしまった
ただ染みついて消えないのは煙草の匂い&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;itoshii hito yo hanare kao nante mikka mo surya sugu ni wasurete shimatta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;tada somitsuite kienai no wa tabako no nioi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Darling, you’ve been gone only three days and already I have totally forgotten your face.&lt;br /&gt;
All that remains is the ever-lingering smell of your cigarettes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;君を待つ日々は足りない　切ない　鳴り止まない
不協和音が響き合って&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;kimi wo matsu hibi wa tarinai setsunai nariyamanai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;fukyouwaon ga hibikiatte&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Waiting for you day after day —&lt;br /&gt; 
it’s futile — heartrending — incessantly ringing —&lt;br /&gt;
a crashing dissonance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;それがあたしの枯れない　溶けない　鳴り止まない
孤独の唄　来来来…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;sore ga atashi no karenai tokenai nariyamanai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;kodoku no uta rai rai rai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That is my unwithering, unthawing, incessantly ringing&lt;br /&gt;
song of solitude.&lt;br /&gt;
Come, come, come!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;かすかな別れを漂わすこともなく
足音は突然　絶切れた
あぁ悲しくも美しき白い冬&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;kasuka no wakare wo tadayowasu koto mo naku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;ashioto wa totsuzen tachikireta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;aa kanashiku utsukushiki shiroi fuyu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Without even a faint hint of parting —&lt;br /&gt;
The sound of footsteps suddenly cut off.&lt;br /&gt;
Ah, the sad and beautiful white winter.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;会えるものならば他に何も望まない
降り積もるは　あの日も雪&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;aeru mono naraba hoka ni nanimo nozomanai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;furitsumoru wa ano hi mo yuki&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If I could only meet you I would not wish for anything else.&lt;br /&gt;
The snow was falling thickly that day.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;君を待つ日々は足りない　切ない　鳴り止まない
不協和音が響き合って
それがあたしの枯れない　溶けない　鳴り止まない
孤独の唄　来来来…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;kimi wo matsu hibi wa tarinai setsunai nariyamanai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;fukyouwaon ga hibikiatte&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;sore ga atashi no karenai tokenai nariyamanai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;kodoku no uta rai rai rai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Waiting for you day after day —&lt;br /&gt; 
it’s futile — heartrending — incessantly ringing —&lt;br /&gt;
a crashing dissonance.&lt;br /&gt;
That is my unwithering, unthawing, incessantly ringing&lt;br /&gt;
song of solitude.&lt;br /&gt;
Come, come, come!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title of the song, “Ukifune”, is the name of a character in the “Tale of Genji” (&lt;em&gt;Genji monogatari&lt;/em&gt;,源氏物語), a masterpiece of Japanese literature from the early 11th century (Heian period), written by the noblewoman and lady-in-waiting Murasaki Shikibu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word &lt;em&gt;ukifune&lt;/em&gt; (浮舟) is the title of &lt;a href=&quot;http://catalog.lambertvillelibrary.org/texts/Asian/japanese/genji/62.htm&quot;&gt;the chapter where the story starts&lt;/a&gt;. It can be translated as “A Drifting Boat”. As is common in the Tale of Genji, the name of the chapter is used as a nickname for the character. In this case, the title and the character’s name were based on a poem she wrote in which she calls herself “a drifting boat” to express her uncertainty and inner turmoil:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;橘の小島の色は変はらじをこの浮舟ぞ行方知られぬ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;tachibana no&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;kojima no iro ha&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;kawaraji wo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;kono ukifune zo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;yukue chirarenu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The enduring hue of the Isle of Orange Trees may well never change, yet there is no knowing now where this drifting boat is bound”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poem is written in winter, with all the land around Uji deeply covered in snow. With her suitor, they have gone out on the Uji river in small boat and moored at the Isle of Orange Trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the story, when she finds herself caught between two powerful suitors, and it seems that whichever one she choses it will end badly, Ukifune tries to drown herself in the Uji river. She fails and becomes a nun. In the Heian period, when noble women became nuns, they would cut off their very long hair. And in the tale, it is indeed autumn by the time Ukifune becomes a nun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The song has many other classical references, such as the use of 〜き adjectives (美しき) and the &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; reading (i.e. the reading derived from the original Chinese proncunciation of the character) &lt;em&gt;rai&lt;/em&gt; of 来 (“come”) used as refrain: &lt;em&gt;rai rai rai&lt;/em&gt;. The word for “song”, &lt;em&gt;uta&lt;/em&gt;, is usually written as 歌 but here as 唄, this more specifically refers to songs accompanied my &lt;em&gt;shamisen&lt;/em&gt;, the traditional three-stringed lute. The song’s mode and melody reflects those traditional songs. It is often said that GO!GO!7188’s music is influenced by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enka&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;enka&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; musical genre, but for this song it is probably more correct to say that it is influenced by the traditional music that gave rise to &lt;em&gt;enka&lt;/em&gt;. And although lost love and loneliness are typical &lt;em&gt;enka&lt;/em&gt; themes, they are universal themes that are also very common themes in the &lt;em&gt;Tale of Genji&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The song starts with a huge reverberating chord, reminiscent of the sound of a &lt;em&gt;biwa&lt;/em&gt; (琵琶), a traditional type of lute that in the Heian period was played at the Imperial court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then follow three verses that repeat the same melody (A) in crescendo. The first word of each verse is a season: spring 春, summer 夏 and autumn 秋.
Then a two new melodies (B/C) are introduced, and a new lyrical theme: the verses address the departed lover. This is followed by the refrain, the single character 来 &lt;em&gt;rai&lt;/em&gt; (“come”) repeated over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then follows and instrumental version of A, followed by a dissonant part reflecting the dissonance in the lyrics.
After this interlude comes a verse in melody B that is the heart of the song, the moment when the lover left. Its final word is “winter” 冬.
The following verse in melody C ends in “snow” 雪 and blends into a repetition of the first verse in melody C and the refrain D: the single syllable &lt;em&gt;ki&lt;/em&gt; is both use as the last syllable of the verse, the &lt;em&gt;ki&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;yuki&lt;/em&gt; (“snow”) and the first syllable of the next verse, &lt;em&gt;kimi&lt;/em&gt; (“you”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The references to the seasons in the song reflect the important role the seasons play in traditional Japanese culture. The Tale of Genji is full of allusions to the seasons, season-specific rituals and poetry. Traditional Japanese poetry (&lt;em&gt;waka&lt;/em&gt;) is also often inspired by the seasons, I discussed some of them in my article &lt;a href=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/articles/my-own-private-japan&quot;&gt;“The Beautiful Japan of the Mind”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The banner picture of this article is the statue of Ukifune in Uji, near Kyoto, where the story is set. It is a picture I took during a visit in the summer of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a live version of the song, recorded at Nihon Budokan in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;Yasunari Kawabata  (川端康成) was the first Japanese novelist to receive the Nobel prize in Literature. I had read his novel “The Master of Go” (名人) and recently I listened to the BBC dramatised version of “A thousand cranes” (千羽鶴). This led me to look up his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1968/kawabata/lecture/&quot;&gt;Nobel lecture&lt;/a&gt; “Japan, the Beautiful and Myself” and it made a great impression on me, in particular his discussion of poems by Zen Buddhist monks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English translation by the eminent &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Seidensticker&quot;&gt;Edward Seidensticker&lt;/a&gt; is excellent, but inevitably some features of the original get lost in translation. This is why I prefer to attempt to read the original Japanese text. 
The Nobel Prize site provides a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1968/kawabata/25542-yasunari-kawabata-nobel-lecture-1968/&quot;&gt;Japanese version of the lecture&lt;/a&gt; but unfortunately it is a series of images of handwritten text. The handwriting is incredibly regular but the images have such a low resolution that the text is very hard to read. Because of the poor quality, to read it I first created &lt;a href=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/kawabata-nobel-lecture/&quot;&gt;a readable version of the Japanese text&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been two other Japanese Nobel laureates, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1994/oe/lecture/&quot;&gt;Kenzaburo Oe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/2017/ishiguro/25124-kazuo-ishiguro-nobel-lecture-2017/&quot;&gt;Kazuo Ishiguro&lt;/a&gt; (who was born in Japan but moved to the UK at the age of five).  Both these authors wrote and delivered their lectures in English, so there is no original Japanese version. Kenzaburo Oe discusses Yasunari Kawabata’s lecture in his own Nobel lecture, titled “Japan, The Ambiguous, and Myself”, a clear reference to the title of Kawabata’s lecture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Kawabata Yasunari, the first Japanese writer who stood on this platform as a winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, delivered a lecture entitled Japan, the Beautiful, and Myself. It was at once very beautiful and vague. I have used the English word vague as an equivalent of that word in Japanese &lt;em&gt;aimaina&lt;/em&gt;. This Japanese adjective could have several alternatives for its English translation. The kind of vagueness that Kawabata adopted deliberately is implied in the title itself of his lecture. It can be transliterated as ‘myself of beautiful Japan’. The vagueness of the whole title derives from the Japanese particle ‘&lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;’ (literally ‘of’) linking ‘Myself’ and ‘Beautiful Japan’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The vagueness of the title leaves room for various interpretations of its implications. It can imply ‘myself as a part of beautiful Japan’, the particle ‘&lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;’ indicating the relationship of the noun following it to the noun preceding it as one of possession, belonging or attachment. It can also imply ‘beautiful Japan and myself’, the particle in this case linking the two nouns in apposition, as indeed they are in the English title of Kawabata’s lecture translated by one of the most eminent American specialists of Japanese literature. He translates ‘Japan, the beautiful and myself’. In this expert translation the traduttore (translator) is not in the least a traditore (betrayer).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will come back to Oe’s views on Kawabata’s lecture later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/2017/ishiguro/25124-kazuo-ishiguro-nobel-lecture-2017/&quot;&gt;Nobel lecture by Kazuo Ishiguro&lt;/a&gt; is also very much worth reading. I like in particular his description of his realisation that “his” Japan is a mental construct:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I was starting to accept that ‘my’ Japan perhaps didn’t much correspond to any place I could go to on a plane; that the way of life of which my parents talked, that I remembered from my early childhood, had largely vanished during the 1960s and 1970s; that in any case, the Japan that existed in my head might always have been an emotional construct put together by a child out of memory, imagination and speculation. And perhaps most significantly, I’d come to realise that with each year I grew older, this Japan of mine — this precious place I’d grown up with — was getting fainter and fainter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always been convinced that any place we visit, or a place where we come from but no longer live, is essentially a place “of the mind”, and that is why everyone’s experience of visiting the same place is so different. Our minds best retain the memories that made the strongest impressions on us, and what these are is different for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been to Japan several times, twice for visits of several months. During these visits I’ve worked with researchers at the Disaster Prevention Research Institute of Kyoto University, and explored the temples and shrines of Kyoto. Kawabata’s views and ideas resonate with me because they are close to my “Japan of the mind”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;source-text-and-translation&quot;&gt;Source text and translation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spelling&quot;&gt;Spelling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kawabata was born in 1899 and received the Nobel prize in 1968. This means that he learned to write in the period between 1900 and 1946 when the usage of &lt;em&gt;kana&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href=&quot;http://spellingsociety.org/uploaded_journals/j19-journal.pdf&quot;&gt;based on historical principles&lt;/a&gt;, i.e. they reflected the historical pronunciation rather than the actual one. For example, the verb &lt;em&gt;iru&lt;/em&gt; “to be” was written in &lt;em&gt;hiragana&lt;/em&gt; as ゐる (&lt;em&gt;wiru&lt;/em&gt;) rather than いる (&lt;em&gt;iru&lt;/em&gt;). The noun &lt;em&gt;kao&lt;/em&gt; “face” was written かほ (&lt;em&gt;kaho&lt;/em&gt;) rather than かお (&lt;em&gt;kao&lt;/em&gt;). In general, many &lt;em&gt;kana&lt;/em&gt; writings used the “h”+vowel (&lt;em&gt;ha&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; etc.) and “w”+vowel (&lt;em&gt;wo&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;wi&lt;/em&gt; etc.) were in modern Japanese only the vowel is used; for some words, what is now &lt;em&gt;ka&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;em&gt;kwa&lt;/em&gt;, written くわ. Other difference were the spelling やう (&lt;em&gt;yau&lt;/em&gt;) instead of よう(&lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;), せう(&lt;em&gt;seu&lt;/em&gt;) instead of  しょう (&lt;em&gt;shou&lt;/em&gt;) and similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1946 the &lt;em&gt;kana&lt;/em&gt; spelling was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_script_reform&quot;&gt;reformed&lt;/a&gt; into the simpler, pronunciation-orientated spelling that is still the standard in modern Japanese. Many &lt;em&gt;kanji&lt;/em&gt; were also simplified.
Nevertheless, Kawabata’s Nobel lecture is largely written in the old spelling, and uses some of the old-style kanji (旧漢字, &lt;em&gt;kyuukanji&lt;/em&gt;). This gives the text a peculiar old-fashioned character that is not obvious from the translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note for example the spelling of 言へる (now 言える) and してゐます (now しています) in one of the first sentences in the essay, a commentary on a poem by the Zen poet Myoe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;明恵のこの歌には、歌物語と言へるぼどの、長く詳しい詞書きがあって、歌のこころを明らかにしてゐます。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Myoe no kono uta ni wa, utamonogatari to iheru hodo no, nagakukuwashii kotobagaki ga atte, uta no kokoro wo akiraka ni shitewimasu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-limits-of-translation&quot;&gt;The limits of translation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Kenzaburo Oe pointed out above, exact translation is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Kawabata comments that the explanatory note (&lt;em&gt;kotobagaki&lt;/em&gt;, 詞書き ) by Myoe on this own poem is so long and detailed that it could be said to be an &lt;em&gt;utamonogatari&lt;/em&gt;(歌物語, meaning a “short Heian period tale in the form of a poem”), a level of detail not present in the translation which simply says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The second poem bears an unusually detailed account of its origins, such as to be an explanation of the heart of its meaning”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the essay, many poems are quoted, most of them by Buddhist monks. The translator, Edward Seidensticker, received help from a Buddhist scholar (Jikai Fujiyoshi,藤吉慈海) for the quotations and references. They had to translate them in a great rush as Kawabata was still writing his lecture in his hotel on the morning that he had to deliver it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the original Japanese text, the old poems are written in classical Japanese (&lt;em&gt;kobun&lt;/em&gt;, 古文) which is a very different language from modern Japanese, with different grammar and vocabulary. As it is impossible to render this in English, we get a modern translation instead. To a Japanese reader, the poems therefore have an entirely different feeling, probably similar to what an English reader experiences with the original &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43521/beowulf-old-english-version&quot;&gt;Beowulf&lt;/a&gt;, or a Dutch speaker reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_kar001kare01_01/_kar001kare01_01_0001.php&quot;&gt;Karel ende Elegast&lt;/a&gt;. This is of course not essential to the message of the lecture but it illustrates the difficulties facing the translator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;zen-buddhism-and-poetry&quot;&gt;Zen Buddhism and poetry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the poems quoted are &lt;em&gt;tanka&lt;/em&gt;, (短歌 meaning “short poem”), a poem consisting of 31 mora in  five units, usually following a 5-7-5-7-7 pattern of mora per unit. For example, the first poem (written here a unit per line to show the structure) is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;春は花&lt;br /&gt;
夏ほととぎす&lt;br /&gt;
秋は月&lt;br /&gt;
冬雪ざえて&lt;br /&gt;
冷しかりけり&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In the spring, cherry blossoms, in the summer the cuckoo.&lt;br /&gt;
In autumn the moon, and in winter the snow, clear, cold.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the second one&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;雲を出でて&lt;br /&gt;
我にとちなふ&lt;br /&gt;
冬の月&lt;br /&gt;
風や身にしむ&lt;br /&gt;
雪や冷めたき&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The winter moon comes from the clouds to keep me company.&lt;br /&gt;
The wind is piercing, the snow is cold.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I find most interesting is Kawabata’s observation on this second poem. Myoe provided the following note about his inspiration for this poem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When the hour of the midnight vigil came, I ceased meditation and descended from the hall on the peak to the lower quarters, and as I did so the moon came from the clouds and set the snow to glowing. The moon was my companion, and not even the wolf howling in the valley brought fear. “&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kawabata says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“My reason for choosing [this poem] has to do with its remarkable gentleness and compassion. Winter moon, going behind the clouds and coming forth again, making bright my footsteps as I go to the meditation hall and descend again, making me unafraid of the wolf: does not the wind sink into you, does not the snow, are you not cold? I choose the poem as a poem of warm, deep, delicate compassion, a poem that has in it the deep quiet of the Japanese spirit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kawabata further discusses a particular poem that is very easy to understand, but nevertheless loses a lot in translation, because the visual effect and structure are untranslatable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;あかあかやあかあかあかやあかあかやあかあかあかやあかあかや月&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;aka aka ya&lt;br /&gt;
aka aka aka ya&lt;br /&gt;
aka aka ya&lt;br /&gt;
aka aka aka ya&lt;br /&gt;
aka aka ya tsuki&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that even this poem is a &lt;em&gt;tanka&lt;/em&gt;! The translation is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Bright, bright, and bright, bright, bright, and bright, bright.&lt;br /&gt;
Bright and bright, bright, and bright, bright moon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kawabata observes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Seeing the moon, he becomes the moon, the moon seen by him becomes him. He sinks into nature, becomes one with nature. The light of the “clear heart” of the priest, seated in the meditation hall in the darkness before the dawn, becomes for the dawn moon its own light.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zen monks like Dogen and Myoe spent a lot of their time in meditation. As a result, they were able to live as much in the present as possible and to have as little sense of self as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dogen and Myoe lived in the 13th century. The final poem I want to highlight is the deathbed poem of the priest Ryokan who lived much later (1758-1831):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;形見として何か残さん舂は花山ほととぎす秋はもみぢ葉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“What shall be my legacy? The blossoms of spring,&lt;br /&gt;
The cuckoo in the hills, the leaves of autumn.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kawabata says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In this poem, as in Dogen’s, the commonest of figures and the commonest of words are strung together without hesitation — no, to particular effect, rather — and so they transmit the very essence of Japan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and further&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Ryokan pursued literature and belief in the benign spirit summarized in the Buddhist phrase “a smiling face and gentle words”. In his last poem he offered nothing as a legacy. He but hoped that after his death nature would remain beautiful. That could be his bequest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phrase “a smiling face and gentle words” is a “four-kanji idiom” (&lt;em&gt;yojijukugo&lt;/em&gt;,四字熟語), pronounced as &lt;em&gt;wagan aigo&lt;/em&gt;. Its origin is from a Buddhist text called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acmuller.net/bud-canon/sutra_of_immeasurable_life.html#div-9&quot;&gt;“The Sutra of Immeasurable Life”&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“With an expression of tenderness in his face and with kindness in his speech, he spoke to others in consonance with their inner thoughts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It carries the connotation that &lt;a href=&quot;https://crd.ndl.go.jp/reference/modules/d3ndlcrdentry/index.php?page=ref_view&amp;amp;id=1000061578&quot;&gt;the bodhisattva speaks gentle words to guide people&lt;/a&gt;. The web site of the Honganji temple in Kyoto has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hongwanji.or.jp/mioshie/words/000916.html&quot;&gt;a nice explanation (in Japanese)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-did-kawabata-include-these-poems-in-his-lecture&quot;&gt;Why did Kawabata include these poems in his lecture?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1994/oe/lecture/&quot;&gt;his own Nobel lecture&lt;/a&gt;, Kenzaburo Oe expresses his views on the use of classical poetry in Kawabata’s lecture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Even as a twentieth-century writer Kawabata depicts his state of mind in terms of the poems written by medieval Zen monks. &lt;em&gt;Most of these poems are concerned with the linguistic impossibility of telling truth.&lt;/em&gt;  According to such poems words are confined within their closed shells. The readers can not expect that words will ever come out of these poems and get through to us. One can never understand or feel sympathetic towards these Zen poems except by giving oneself up and willingly penetrating into the closed shells of those words.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Why did Kawabata boldly decide to read those extremely esoteric poems in Japanese before the audience in Stockholm? I look back almost with nostalgia upon the straightforward bravery which he attained towards the end of his distinguished career and with which he made such a confession of his faith. Kawabata had been an artistic pilgrim for decades during which he produced a host of masterpieces. After those years of his pilgrimage, only by making a confession as to how he was fascinated by such inaccessible Japanese poems that baffle any attempt fully to understand them, was he able to talk about ‘Japan, the Beautiful, and Myself’, that is, about the world in which he lived and the literature which he created.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;A whimsical fedi music collaboration between Eidon and Wim. This is a twin post, the other version is &lt;a href=&quot;https://noblogo.org/eidon/daffodils&quot;&gt;on Eidon’s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the finished track. We hope you like it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;audio controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/audio&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;eidon-says&quot;&gt;Eidon says:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;“It &lt;/span&gt;
all started from the title, really. “Daffodils”. Nice word, which reminds of many things – an Arcadia of beautiful flowers and their scent, or Wordsworth’s famous poem, for instance. Among the many spurious thoughts that such a word could evoke, there was one that triggered the resolve to create a piece of music from it: the presence of letters that can be interpreted as note names, together with others that can not. Of the many possible mappings, this one was chosen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/Theme.png&quot; alt=&quot;A piece of musical score showing the theme of Daffodils.&quot; title=&quot;A piece of musical score showing the theme of Daffodils.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The theme of &quot;Daddodils&quot;: ‘D’, ‘A’, ‘F’, ‘F’, rest, ‘D’, rest, rest, (rest)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where ‘real’ notes where used when a music counterpart existed, and `imaginary’ (inaudible) notes otherwise. The singular form led to 8 quavers and an easy 4/4 metre. The result was found sufficiently interesting and worth pursuing, and a composition was started from there. Three voices, initially appointed two two electric guitars and electric bass, with the theme exposed and repeated by the first guitar, soon joined by the cortege of its companions, all moving in an ostinato slow-pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospective, it is possible that, from the very beginning, it all was leading to Wordsworth’s poem – the choice of the tempo, for instance. Whatever the actual case, at some point it became clear that the connection with “I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud” had to be made explicit. At first we thought to only sing the poem’s final verses; and then Wim had the great idea to recite the whole poem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track was created with &lt;a href=&quot;http://tuxguitar.com.ar/&quot;&gt;TuxGuitar&lt;/a&gt;, a nice tabulature editor whose notes input interfaces include guitar fretboards. So yes all the instruments you can hear in Daffodils have been composed… on guitar ^_^. Some of the sounds were produced via the Timbres Of Heaven soundfont, while for others we used MuseScore, after importing MIDI files exported from TuxGuitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/Tux.png&quot; alt=&quot;TuxGuitar UI.&quot; title=&quot;The TuxGuitar UI.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The TuxGuitar UI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://musescore.org/&quot;&gt;MuseScore&lt;/a&gt; is much more powerful than TuxGuitar. It allows to orchestrate voices from multiple soundfonts at the same time, for instance, and to export the voices as separate audio files. Once the voices have been chosen and isolated, we used Audacity to orchestrate them together. The original TuxGuitar voices were then mixed with MuseScore voices from the Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra,  and the Nice Keys Suite soundfonts, plus that of a Steinway piano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audacityteam.org/&quot;&gt;Audacity&lt;/a&gt; is perhaps not the best tool one could use, though it has certain valuable features. One such feature is so-called Envelope Tool: with it, it is possible to finely control the volume of each voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/Audax.png&quot; alt=&quot;Audacity UI for the Envelope Tool.&quot; title=&quot;Audacity UI for the Envelope Tool.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Each voice is wrapped in a “control envelope”, which changes the volume of the track proportionally to the ‘height’ of the envelope.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows fade-ins and fade-outs, and thus can simulate the entrance and exit of instruments. This has been used extensively in Daffodils!
“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wim-says&quot;&gt;Wim says:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;“Eidon &lt;/span&gt;
wrote this great track “Daffodils” as he explained above, and he sent me a draft and asked if I could recite the verses from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45521/i-wandered-lonely-as-a-cloud&quot;&gt;Wordsworth’s poem&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t know what he thought my voice would contribute to the work, maybe he wanted a Flemish-Scottish accent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eidon had in mind that I would recite the final two verses only:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And then my heart with pleasure fills,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;And dances with the daffodils.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I misunderstood him, and I recited the entire poem. That turned out to be serendipitous, as we are both happy with the final result. But I’m running ahead of myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used my laptop’s built-in mic as that is all I have. The audio quality is acceptable but far from great, so from the start I had this idea that I wanted to apply some distorting effects to the voice. I thought it might work well with the track which is quite modern and rather different from what a more conventional composer might associate with the image of daffodils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d never done this before, so it was an interesting experiment. I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audacityteam.org/&quot;&gt;Audacity&lt;/a&gt; for the recording and for all processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recorded the audio in two takes, and combined the best parts. There is nothing to say about the recording: I just read the poem out loud, at a pace that seemed natural to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I improved the audio quality. I knew from past experience that a good way to do it is to apply the following effects:
• Noise Reduction with default settings
• Equalisation (Graphic EQ) with the “Bass Boost” preset
• &lt;a href=&quot;https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/compressor.html&quot;&gt;Compressor&lt;/a&gt; with default settings
• &lt;a href=&quot;https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/reverb.html&quot;&gt;Reverb&lt;/a&gt; with the “Vocal I” preset&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then also doubled the voice, with a very slight shift between the tracks, so there is no perceptible echo but the sounds is a little bit fuller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially I had wanted to use only the vocoder. But Audacity’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/vocoder.html&quot;&gt;Vocoder effect&lt;/a&gt; is not quite what I had in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default setting for the Vocoder results in a rather tame distortion. My settings are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    Distance: 50.0
    Output choice: Both channels
    Number of vocoder bands: 60
    Amplitude of original audio (percent): 100.0
    Amplitude of white noise (percent): 0.0
    Amplitude of Radar Needles (percent): 50.0
    Frequency of Radar Needles (Hz): 80.0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is a bit like speaking through a tube, with added radar needles, a series of short pulses which give a robotic effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/phaser.html&quot;&gt;Phaser&lt;/a&gt; could introduce some interesting distortions. Again, the default effect is quite tame. I used the following setting, on a separate copy of the voice track:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    Stages: 20
    Dry/Wet: 180
    LFO Frequency (Hz): 0.6
    LFO Start Phase (deg.): 50.0
    Depth: 120
    Feedback (%): 75
    Output gain (dB): -3.0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is a space-like oscillator sound overlaying the speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was still not happy with the result so I added another copy of the voice track Reverb using the “Church Hall” preset, which gives a huge echoing sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I combined these three tracks with the original one, taking care that I did not entirely drown out the recitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then combined this track with Eidon’s music. I tweaked the pauses between the verses to match the music and tweaked the volume of the voice here and there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final verses are repeated three times, because somehow I thought that fit with the music.
“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;eidon-says-1&quot;&gt;Eidon says:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;“No &lt;/span&gt;
greater bias than the authors’ opinion, maybe, though we are quite pleased with the results. Music and verse dance together, and hearts with pleasure fill. Therefore, it is likely that this first move into musical/poetical co-creation shall be followed by new experiments soon!
“&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/shinshu-prayer_1600x600.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;I am currently reading the original Japanese version of “Tokyo Ueno Station” by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miri_Yu&quot;&gt;Yu Miri&lt;/a&gt;,『JR上野駅公園口』. It’s a very nice but difficult novel, I may write more about it later. After I wrote the &lt;a href=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/articles/four-wisdoms&quot;&gt;article on the Buddhist prayer “The Four Wisdoms”&lt;/a&gt;, I came across a passage in the novel that describes a Buddhist funeral and it contains a prayer used by the  Jōdo Shinshū (浄土真宗, “The True Essence of the Pure Land Teaching”),  known as Shinshū in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-prayer&quot;&gt;The prayer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prayer in the book is written in archaic Japanese with old forms of &lt;em&gt;kanji&lt;/em&gt; and grammar and uncommon words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;　 　 　 　 長 本 浄 娑 ツ 佛 イ 弘&lt;br /&gt;
　 　 　 　 時 師 土 婆 子 恩 ヅ 誓&lt;br /&gt;
　 　 　 　 ニ 釋 无 永 ニ フ レ ノ&lt;br /&gt;
　 　 　 　 慈 迦 爲 劫 弥 カ ノ チ&lt;br /&gt;
　 　 　 　 恩 ノ ヲ ノ 陀 ク ト カ&lt;br /&gt;
　 　 　 　 ヲ チ 期 苦 ヲ オ キ ラ&lt;br /&gt;
　 　 　 　 報 カ ス ヲ 念 モ ニ ヲ&lt;br /&gt;
　 　 　 　 ズ ラ ル ス ズ ヒ カ カ&lt;br /&gt;
　 　 　 　 ベ ナ コ テ ベ ツ 娑 フ&lt;br /&gt;
　 　 　 　 シ リ ト 、 シ 、 婆 ラ&lt;br /&gt;
　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 ヲ ズ&lt;br /&gt;
　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 い バ&lt;br /&gt;
　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 デ&lt;br /&gt;
　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 ン&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-puzzle&quot;&gt;The puzzle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could not understand the poem, but I was curious about its meaning so I tried to find out. First of all, here is a list of the special &lt;em&gt;kanji&lt;/em&gt;, words and constructions that I did not understand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;弘誓 (ぐぜい, &lt;em&gt;guzei&lt;/em&gt;): &lt;a href=&quot;http://bschawaii.org/shindharmanet/bloom/ab-writings/salvation/&quot;&gt;Buddha’s universal vow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;娑婆 (しゃば, &lt;em&gt;shaba&lt;/em&gt;): The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sah%C4%81&quot;&gt;Sahā world&lt;/a&gt;, the mundane world.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;佛: an older form of 仏 (&lt;em&gt;butsu&lt;/em&gt;), Buddha&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;仏恩 (ブツオン、ぶっとん, &lt;em&gt;button&lt;/em&gt;): Buddha’s blessings, the grace of Buddha’s compassion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;弥陀 (みだ,&lt;em&gt;mida&lt;/em&gt;): Amitabha (a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Buddhism/Celestial-buddhas-and-bodhisattvas&quot;&gt;celestial Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, the principal buddha in Pure Land Buddhism)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;永劫 (えいごう, here pronounced &lt;em&gt;yōgō&lt;/em&gt;): Eternity, perpetuity. 劫 (&lt;em&gt;kō&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;gō&lt;/em&gt;) means &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalpa_%28aeon%29&quot;&gt;kalpa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;浄土 (じょうど, &lt;em&gt;jōdo&lt;/em&gt;): Lit. “pure land”, esp. the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sukhavati&quot;&gt;Western Pure Land&lt;/a&gt; paradise of Amitabha.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;无爲: old kanji for 無為 &lt;em&gt;mui&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110810104405611&quot;&gt;asaṃskṛta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;the ‘unconditioned’, a term referring to anything that transcends conditioned (saṃskṛta) existence in the state of saṃsāra.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;期スル (ごする,&lt;em&gt;go suru&lt;/em&gt;): to live&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;本師 (ホンシ,&lt;em&gt;honshin&lt;/em&gt;): Lit. “fundamental guru”, i.e. Buddha&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;釋: an older form of 釈, lit. &lt;em&gt;shaka&lt;/em&gt;, short for &lt;em&gt;Shakamuni&lt;/em&gt; (釈迦牟尼), the historical Buddha.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;慈恩 (じおん_jion_): deep compassion, benevolence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ナリ: なり (&lt;em&gt;nari&lt;/em&gt;) is the classical version of である, “to be”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ベシ: べし (&lt;em&gt;beshi&lt;/em&gt;) is the classical version of べき, “something one ought to do”. In the prayer, 念 ずべし means 念 ずるべき,”should pray”, and 報 ずべし means 報 ずるべき, “should inform”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these terms and the &lt;em&gt;furigana&lt;/em&gt; in the novel, I could do a transcription in &lt;em&gt;romaji&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;guzei no chikara wo kafurazuba&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;idzure no toki ni ka shaba wo iden&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;button fukaku omohitsu,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;tsune ni mida wo nen zubeshi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;shaba yōgo no ku wo sute,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;jōdo mui wo go suru koto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;honshi shaka no chikara nari&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;jōji ni jion wo hō zubeshi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at least I can now pronounce the prayer, and I get a rough idea of the meaning. But of course I wanted to know the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-origin&quot;&gt;The origin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By searching for snippets rewritten with modern &lt;em&gt;kanji&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;hiragana&lt;/em&gt;, I found that the prayer is taken from a book of hymns called &lt;em&gt;Kōsō Wasan&lt;/em&gt; (『高僧和讃』, the “Japanese Hymns of Praise of the Virtuous Priest”), a collection of hymns written by the founder of the sect, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.learnreligions.com/shinran-449983&quot;&gt;Shinran (親鸞)&lt;/a&gt;, who lived between 1173 and 1263 and was a remarkable person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, these are the two final hymns from “Twenty-six Hymns based on the Writings of Master Shan-tao”. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chinabuddhismencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=Shan-tao&quot;&gt;Shan-tao&lt;/a&gt; is one of the seven masters (patriarchs) of Shinshū. He lived from 613 to 681 and is generally credited for popularizing the &lt;em&gt;nembutsu&lt;/em&gt; as the reciting of Amida’s name (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-meaning&quot;&gt;The meaning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complete works of Shinran in English translation are available &lt;a href=&quot;http://shinranworks.com/&quot;&gt;on line&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://shinranworks.com/hymns-in-japanese/hymns-of-the-pure-land-masters/shan-tao/&quot;&gt;translation of the two hymns&lt;/a&gt; taken from there is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Had we not received the power of the universal Vow,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;When can we part from this Saha world?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Reflecting deeply on the Buddha’s benevolence,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Let us think on Amida always.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Casting off long kalpas of painful existence in this world of Saha,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We live in expectation of the Pure Land, the uncreated;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;That is the power of our teacher, Shakyamuni;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Let us respond always in gratitude for his compassion and benevolence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pure Land Buddhism holds that there is a kind of Paradise called the Pure Land, and once one is there it is easier to reach Nirvana. Shinran advocated to trust to the power of Amitābha (&lt;em&gt;Amida&lt;/em&gt;), as made manifest in his Universal Vow, to attain enlightenment. The main Jōdo Shinshū practice is called &lt;em&gt;nembutsu&lt;/em&gt;, “Mindfulness of the Buddha”. The nembutsu is simply reciting the phrase &lt;em&gt;Namu Amida Butsu&lt;/em&gt; (“I take refuge in Amitābha Buddha”, written 南無阿弥陀佛). For more information see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shinbuddhism.info/kw86.htm&quot;&gt;the detailed discussion of the meaning of the hymns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-conclusion&quot;&gt;The conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is yet another example of how reading Japanese remains a difficult but very stimulating activity for me: there are lots of riddles to be solved. In translation, most of the mystery disappears. And every time I look into such a little mystery, I learn lots of new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The banner picture is of the Nishi Hongan-ji (本願寺, Temple of the Primal Vow)) in Kyōto, the largest of all the Jōdo Shinshū branches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <content type="html">
        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/four-wisdoms_1600x600.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;A friend asked me about if I knew a Japanese Buddhist prayer suitable for a funeral. I knew that at funerals and memorial services, the monks chant Buddhist text in &lt;em&gt;bongo&lt;/em&gt; (梵語), a Japanese transliteration of Sanskrit. The practice is known as &lt;em&gt;shōmyō&lt;/em&gt; (声明) and a text that is often chanted is called &lt;em&gt;shichi&lt;/em&gt; (四智), “the Four Wisdoms”, or &lt;em&gt;shichibongo&lt;/em&gt; (四智梵語) in full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-four-wisdoms-text-in-japanese&quot;&gt;The Four Wisdoms text in Japanese&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, &lt;em&gt;shōmyō&lt;/em&gt; texts are written using specific and quite unusual Chinese characters, but they are used purely for their phonetic value, not for their meaning. Here is the text in full, from the site of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buzan.or.jp/index-1-1.html&quot;&gt;Buzan sect&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/easia/shingon.html&quot;&gt;Shingon Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;. It also has a recording of the chanting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/shingon_kongoukai.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chinese characters written left-to-right, top-to-bottom, columns of irregular length&quot; title=&quot;Chinese characters written left-to-right, top-to-bottom, columns of irregular length&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The Four Wisdoms in kanji and hiragana, from the site of the Buzan sect&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same text with only very minor differences is used also by the sects of &lt;a href=&quot;https://tendaiuk.com/tendai-buddhism/&quot;&gt;Tendai Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;, but I focus here on Shingon only for convenience. The word &lt;em&gt;shingon&lt;/em&gt; (真言, lit. “True Words”) is the translation of the Sanskrit word Mantra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-the-japanese-text-to-the-original-sanskrit&quot;&gt;From the Japanese text to the original Sanskrit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the &lt;em&gt;kanji&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;katakana&lt;/em&gt; for this text in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tais.repo.nii.ac.jp/?action=repository_action_common_download&amp;amp;item_id=450&amp;amp;item_no=1&amp;amp;attribute_id=22&amp;amp;file_no=1&quot;&gt;a Japanese academic paper on the meaning of the &lt;em&gt;shichibongo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;四智梵語&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
オム　バザラ　サトバ　ソギャラカ&lt;br /&gt;
唵　　嚩日囉　薩怛嚩　蘇蘗　囉賀&lt;br /&gt;
バザラ　アラタンノウ　マドタラン&lt;br /&gt;
嚩日囉　囉　怛　曩　　摩覩怛覧&lt;br /&gt;
バザラ　タラマ　キャヤタイ&lt;br /&gt;
嚩日囉　達　麽　誐　夜那&lt;br /&gt;
バザラ　キャラマ　キャロ　ハムバ&lt;br /&gt;
嚩日囉　羯　　磨　迦　嚕　婆　縛&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This transliterates in &lt;em&gt;romaji&lt;/em&gt; as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;shichibongo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;om bazara-satoba sogyaraka&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;bazara-aratannou madotaran&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;bazara-tarama kyayatai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;bazara-kyarama kyaro hamba&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same paper also gave the original Sanskrit phrasing, transliterated in the roman alphabet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;oṃ vajrasattva samgrahād&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;vajraratnam anuttaraṃ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;vajradharma gāyanair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;vajrakarma karo bhava&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-the-sanskrit-text-say&quot;&gt;What does the Sanskrit text say?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sanskrit version allowed me to search for a translation. I found one in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.routledgehandbooks.com/doi/10.4324/9781315172354.ch3&quot;&gt;a book on Japanese music&lt;/a&gt; that discussed &lt;em&gt;shōmyō&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oṃ.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Receiving the blessing of the wisdom of Vajra-sattva,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;we obtain the ultimate vajra-ratna.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;By chanting the vajra-dharma,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;we may attain the vajra-karma of enlightenment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not familiar with esoteric Buddhism so I found this translation hard to understand. I therefore looked a bit further into this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-background-on-esoteric-buddhism&quot;&gt;Some background on esoteric Buddhism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need to know about &lt;em&gt;Vajrayana&lt;/em&gt;, also know as Esoteric  Buddhism, the Buddhist tradition of which Shingon Buddhism is a branch. According to the according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Vajrayana&quot;&gt;Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vajrayana, (Sanskrit: “Diamond Vehicle” or “Thunderbolt Vehicle”) form of Tantric Buddhism that developed in India and neighbouring countries, notably Tibet. Vajrayana, in the history of Buddhism, marks the transition from Mahayana speculative thought to the enactment of Buddhist ideas in individual life. The term vajra (Sanskrit: “diamond” or “thunderbolt” ) is used to signify the absolutely real and indestructible in a human being, as opposed to the fictions an individual entertains about himself and his nature; yana is the spiritual pursuit of the ultimately valuable and indestructible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Buddhism/Vajrayana-Tantric-or-Esoteric-Buddhism&quot;&gt;further&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vajrayana first emerged in various parts of India and Sri Lanka. The esoteric nature of Tantric doctrine and practice makes identifying the origins of the Vajrayana school difficult, but some Buddhist traditions associate them with Nagarjuna and Asanga and therefore suggest that Vajrayana began to develop quietly in the 2nd or 4th century CE. Vajrayana was prominent in India and Tibet, and a form of it spread to China and then to Japan, where it became associated with the Tendai and Shingon schools.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we need to know about the concept of the &lt;em&gt;mandala&lt;/em&gt;. Again according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/mandala-diagram&quot;&gt;Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mandala, (Sanskrit: “circle”) in Hindu and Buddhist Tantrism, a symbolic diagram used in the performance of sacred rites and as an instrument of meditation. The mandala is basically a representation of the universe, a consecrated area that serves as a receptacle for the gods and as a collection point of universal forces.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-mandala-of-the-diamond-realm&quot;&gt;The Mandala of the Diamond Realm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shingon Buddhism makes frequent use of two &lt;em&gt;mandalas&lt;/em&gt;, the Mandala of the Womb Realm and the Mandala of the Diamond Realm (Kongōkai Mandala, 金剛界 曼荼羅). &lt;em&gt;kongō&lt;/em&gt; (金剛) means “diamond” or “adamant, and is a translation of the Sanskrit “vajra”. These realms and their composition are based on an esoteric Buddhist sutra called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shingon.org/teachings/ShingonMikkyo/KongochoKyo.html&quot;&gt;Vajrasekhara Sutra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Diamond Realm (金剛界 Kongōkai) is a metaphysical space inhabited by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thezengateway.com/teachings/the-five-wisdom-buddhas-vairocana&quot;&gt;Five Wisdom Buddhas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Shingon Buddhism, there is a group of deities, known as the Vajra Bodhisattva. The “Four Wisdoms” refers to the four Vajra Bodhisattva that surround &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shingon.org/teachings/ShingonMikkyo/Dainichi.html&quot;&gt;Dainichi Nyorai&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/mandala-guidebook.html&quot;&gt;Shiin-e (四印会) section&lt;/a&gt; of the Kongōkai Mandala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/Kongokai-shiin-e.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Detail of the Kongōkai Mandala showing five seated Buddha-like figures arranges in a cross, within a circle&quot; title=&quot;Detail of the Kongōkai Mandala showing five seated Buddha-like figures arranges in a cross, within a circle&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Shiin-e (四印会) and ichiin-e (一印会) sections of the Kongōkai Mandala, Heian period, 9th century (Tōji Temple, Kyōto, National Treasure) (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kongokai.jpg)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dainichi Nyorai (大日如来) is the Buddha in the highest form of existence, dharmakaya, &lt;em&gt;hosshin&lt;/em&gt; (法身) in Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;finally-back-to-the-four-wisdoms&quot;&gt;Finally, back to the Four Wisdoms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus the Four Wisdoms of the text refer to these four Vajra Bodhisattva:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kongōsatta 金剛薩埵 ( Vajra-sattva, “diamond being”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kongōhō 金剛宝 ( Vajra-ratna, “diamond treasure”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kongōhō 金剛法 ( Vajra-dharma, “diamond law”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kongōgyō 金剛業 ( Vadra-karma, “diamond action” ).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the explanation on the site of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buzan.or.jp/index-1-1.html&quot;&gt;Buzan sect&lt;/a&gt;, these four bodhisattva are identified with the four wisdom buddha surrounding Dainichi Nyorai in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thezengateway.com/teachings/the-five-wisdom-buddhas-vairocana&quot;&gt;Five Wisdom Buddhas&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Four Wisdoms represents the wisdom of the four Wisdom Buddhas, and by making offerings to each other, the Four Wisdoms represent the entire mandala of Vajrayana, with Dainichi Nyorai in the center.”&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;This is a simple and low-tech recipe for frozen yoghurt with just two ingredients. It uses dates as a natural source of sugar. The amounts are for two portions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;250 g Greek style yoghurt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;50 g Medjool dates, pitted and chopped&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon candied orange peel (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preparation&quot;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put the yoghurt, dates and orange peel in a freezer-safe container and stir.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For the lazy way, place the mixture in the fridge for a few hours or overnight (so the dates will dissolve) and stir; for the quick way, blend the mixture.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put the container in the freezer for 20 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stir the mixture well. Make sure to loosen ice forming on the walls of the container and to mix it in.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeat the freezing and stirring until you get the desired consistency. For soft ice texture this will take about four more cycles, for a more solid texture about seven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/learning-japanese-reading-murakami_1600x600.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in my previous posts (&lt;a href=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/articles/reading-murakami/&quot;&gt;Reading Murakami in Japanese&lt;/a&gt;,
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/articles/more-on-learning-japanese/&quot;&gt;Some tips for reading Japanese as a learner&lt;/a&gt;,
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/articles/learning-japanese/&quot;&gt;My journey of learning Japanese&lt;/a&gt;), I started reading Murakami Haruki’s “1Q84” in Japanese in October 2014. The paperback version consists of 6 volumes (2 for each Book), 2,057 pages in total. At the end of June 2020, I finally finished the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had started learning Japanese in early 2011 in preparation for a research trip. Unfortunately because of the tsunami and the nuclear disaster the trip didn’t go ahead. But I did go to Japan for two months in the summer of 2012 and again in the summer of 2014. So I had been learning Japanese for about four years and had four months of a more or less immersive experience before I started on the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I had been learning Japanese  in a rather haphazard, not very systematic way, because I felt it was more fun that way. Nevertheless, I had put in a considerable amount of time and effort.
I took some group lessons but they did not continue beyond the very basics. Then I took one-to-one lessons with a Japanese teacher, which was a much better way to learn. The lessons focused on conversation and grammar but we didn’t cover kanji. I started learning kanji using several apps. The one I’ve been using most consistently is Memrise, to study the meanings of the Jouyou kanji. I don’t like mnemonics-based methods like Heisig’s, and I’ve paid the price for that, because apparently with that method you can learn all readings and meanings for all 2,136 Jouyou kanji in a few months. Whereas all these years later, I still have to practise every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what did I learn through reading Murakami? Despite &lt;a href=&quot;http://selftaughtjapanese.com/2016/07/08/what-its-like-reading-haruki-murakami-novels-in-their-original-japanese/&quot;&gt;what others may say&lt;/a&gt;, I learned that reading Murakami is hard. Initially, a page took me more than half an hour. Now, after six years, it takes me about five minutes, but that is still much lower than my English reading speed: reading the same passage in English only takes a minute. Arguably Murakami’s writing style is comparatively straightforward, and personally I had (even) more difficulty reading Banana Yoshimoto’s “Tokage” than 1Q84, but that doesn’t mean that I found Murakami easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I determined, despite that or because of it, not to give up. I kept going, a few pages at a time. Eventually I got there.
I found that reading with a dictionary and looking up the readings and meanings of any character or word I didn’t know is not only wonderfully engaging but also really works as a way to learn Japanese. My reading skills have improved dramatically, and so have my vocabulary and my grasp of grammar. As a result, my writing, listing and speaking skills have also improved. So on the whole, I would recommend reading a Japanese novel as a way of learning Japanese, if you are not in a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I also learned I still have so much to learn. I still don’t know all readings for the Jouyou kanji, and keep forgetting the meanings. I still struggle with conversation (although that may partly be as a result of my tendency of overcomplicating things and wanting to be too precise) and with handwriting. I started handwriting practice in 2018. It requires a better understanding of the structure of the kanji, but it is fun and my recall is improving. I still have a long way to go before I’ll be able to write all Jouyou kanji.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have written down some of my observations before: &lt;a href=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/articles/reading-murakami/&quot;&gt;Reading Murakami in Japanese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/articles/more-on-learning-japanese/&quot;&gt;Some tips for reading Japanese as a learner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/articles/learning-japanese/&quot;&gt;My journey of learning Japanese&lt;/a&gt;. One specific thing I started noticing only when reading the last two volumes of 1Q84 is that, when I see a word and I think I can’t pronounce it, often it turns out I can after all, if I just make a little more effort, a kind of mental jump into the unknown. There is a wonderful Japanese expression for this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kiyomizu no butai kara tobioriru&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;清水の舞台から飛び降りる&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(きよみずのぶたいからとびおりる)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which literally translates as “to jump off the platform of the Kiyomizu-dera temple”, but means “to make a leap into the dark”. (The platform of the beautiful and ancient Kiyomizu-dera temple in Kyoto offers great views but is also twelve metres high, so jumping off it may not be a good idea.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall is sometimes more about daring rather than about remembering: rather than going for conscious recall, trust your unconscious mind to pick the right reading. You actually remember more than you think you remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;coda-the-novel-itself&quot;&gt;Coda: the novel itself&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may wonder: having spent nearly six years reading it, do I think it is a good book? I do. It was certainly for the most part entertaining and interesting. I have written three posts about various remarkable points in the book (&lt;a href=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/articles/repetition-in-1Q84/&quot;&gt;Repetition in Murakami’s 1Q84&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/articles/1Q84-kuukisanagi/&quot;&gt;Why the ‘Little People’ say ‘Ho ho’&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/articles/cold-or-not/&quot;&gt;Cold or not: a riddle in Murakami’s 1Q84&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there aspects I don’t like? Yes. The ending leaves me wanting to know what happened to the other characters. Also, there is a bit too much repetition, which I think is a consequence of the book being published in three parts, and in every part Murakami (or his publisher) has felt it necessary to provide sufficient background on what happened before so that each part can be read on its own. There are some parts that I found a bit slow, because I was impatient to get back to the plot, but usually even these parts were actually quite interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, will I ever re-read it? Maybe, if my Japanese reading speed ever gets close to my English one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/brownies_1600.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;This is a simple and quick recipe for delicious brownies with very few ingredients. It uses dates as a natural source of sugar. The rich high-cocoa content chocolate makes butter unnecessary so they happen to be vegan. The amounts are for two brownies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;50 g dark chocolate (70% cocoa)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;25 g extra dark chocolate (85% cocoa)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;50 g Medjool dates, pitted and chopped&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;50 self-rising white wheat flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 tablespoons tepid water&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;12 g walnuts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon candied orange peel (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preparation&quot;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heat the chocolate au bain marie, ideally at 35 °C.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When the chocolate has melted, gradually add the flour, mixing thoroughly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add 2 tablespoons of water, mix well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then add the dates and the organge peel, mix well while adding in the rest of the water. The mixture must be moist and stick together.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then add the walnuts. You can also simply push the walnuts into the dough just before baking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put the mixture in small ramekins lined with aluminium foil.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preheat the oven on 160 °C and bake for 25 minutes at 160 °C.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leave to cool in the ramekins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/cold-or-not_1600x600.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/articles/reading-murakami&quot;&gt;mentioned before&lt;/a&gt;, I have been slowly reading Haruki Murakami’s novel 1Q84 in Japanese. Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/23/magazine/the-fierce-imagination-of-haruki-murakami.html&quot;&gt;all his novels&lt;/a&gt;, this novel is many things. For this article I want to view it as a reflection on morality. Almost all of the characters have to make complex moral choices based on incomplete or incorrect information. One such character is Tamaru, a bodyguard and security expert in the service of a rich old widow who has embarked on a personal crusade against domestic violence. He is at the same time a very cultured person and a consummate professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this article is really about a something that puzzled me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of the final chapters (Chapter 25 of Book 3), just before he has to make a very hard moral choice, Tamaru recounts an interesting story about the famous Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jung. He explains how Jung lived in a large house in Zürich, but wanted a place to think and work in solitude. So he built a place which he called the “Tower”, in Bollingen near the shore of the Zürich lake. He built it with his own hands from stones from a local quarry, and had to join the guild become a licensed stone mason to be allowed to do so. It was an austere place, without gas, electricity or running water. On the lintel above the entrance, Jung engraved a phrase which in Japanese reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;冷たくても、冷たくなくても、神はここにいる&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tsumetakutemo, tsumetakunakutemo, kami wa koko ni iru&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the English translation by Philip Gabriel, this runs “Cold or Not, God Is Present”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This phrase is also the title of the chapter, and I think that because of this story about Jung, this chapter might very well be the key chapter of the entire novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was intrigued by the phrase and started to read up on Jung, to try and find out more about this story. It turns out that the story as told by Tamaru is not entirely accurate: Jung did indeed build the tower with his own hands. He started building it in 1923, when he was 48, and worked on it and reshaped it for most of the rest of his life &lt;a href=&quot;https://thefirstgates.com/2014/01/02/jungs-tower-simplicity-and-the-inner-life/&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. And he did put an inscription above the entrance of the original tower. It is the same inscription that was first engraved over the entrance of his house in Küsnacht &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jungatlanta.com/articles/summer14-two-houses.pdf&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the words as mentioned by Tamaru are different from the inscription. The original inscription is in Latin and reads “Vocatus atque non vocatus deus aderit”, which translates as “Bidden or unbidden, the god will be present”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The origin of this phrase is interesting: the Latin phrase is from the Adagia, a collection of sayings from ancient sources collected by Erasmus. The actual source is the  “History of the Peloponnesian War”, written around 400 BC by the Athenian historian and general Thucydides. In it, he recounts how the Spartans asked the Oracle of Apollo in Delphi if it would go well with them if they went to war with Athens. The oracle answered that if they put all their strength into the war, victory would be theirs, and that “the god himself would be there, whether invoked or uninvoked” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.harvardreview.org/content/culled-and-not-culled-the-poet-will-be-there/#return-link-5&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jung himself knew this background, and he commented “It says: yes, the god will be on the spot, but in what form and to what purpose? I have put the inscription there to remind my patients and myself: Timor dei initium sapientiae.” (Fear of God is the start of wisdom) &lt;a href=&quot;http://carljungdepthpsychology.blogspot.com/2017/03/carl-jung-it-is-delphic-oracle-though.html&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;. Jung’s view on religion was that people need a God because a person needs to recognise a higher authority than the ego. Without a God, a person will make a God out of something else. So there will be a God in people’s lives, whether they want it or not, for good or for worse. Hence the choice of the phrase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the original phrase is different from Tamaru’s quote, either Tamaru has it wrong, or in the parallel universe of 1Q84, the inscription is different. That is of course very well possible: as the novel makes clear, 1Q84 is superficially the same as 1984 but differs from it in many subtle ways; Tamaru being a person who is very precise in his mental habits, it is not so likely that he would not have checked the translation of a phrase which he considers so important. In fact, he comments that “There’s some deep allusion here, something difficult to interpret.”. So I am assuming that in the 1Q84 universe, the inscription is different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am of course not the first one to point this out &lt;a href=&quot;http://hyoshiok.hatenablog.com/entry/20130617/p1&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;, and several people have surmised that this is a pun on cold/called, [&lt;a href=&quot;https://chazzw.wordpress.com/2011/11/13/more-of-the-things-you-learn-in-books/&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://citronimus.de/haruki-murakami-1q84/&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;] because a possible English translation of the Latin phrase is “Called or uncalled, God is present”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As explained above, this is only one possible translation – “vocatus” could be translated as “bidden” or “summoned” as well, and “the god” is more accurate than “God” – and somehow I find this theory not satisfactory.
At first sight, the cold/called theory may seem to be corroborated because Tamaru mentions that the Catholic orphanage where he grew up was always cold, even in summer. However, in Japanese, Tamaru there uses the word “samui” (寒い) which means that it felt cold to him, whereas in the phrase he uses the word “tsumetai” (冷たい), which means that something is cold. Because of his experience in that cruel place, he also says that as far as he is concerned, if God existed, He could not be said to be kind at all. The Japanese adjective shinsetsu (親切,しんせつ) which he uses means “kind,” but is used to describe the character of someone based on their actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am therefore inclined to interpret the “tsumetai” as “emotionally cold, unfeeling, indifferent”. In other words, God is here, but we don’t know if he is indifferent or not. That is to my mind also closer to Jung’s own interpretation of the Latin phrase, and yet different of course, as might be expected in 1Q84.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it is a coincidence that Murakami introduces Jung at the end of this novel. Arguably, the actions of many of the characters match Jung’s views on good and evil. For example Ushikawa, who is the protagonist of the chapter, and quite a creep, is at some point shown his dark side (&lt;a href=&quot;http://compassreview.org/summer03/6.html&quot;&gt;what Jung calls the Shadow&lt;/a&gt;) but decides to embrace it instead of reject it. 
 And it is not a stretch to view the Little People as a kind of collective god: they have no individuality but collectively they have supernatural powers. They are also clearly not bound by human morals, and are (not unlike the Greek gods) quite indifferent to the fate of humans. And they speak through a human, i.e. a prophet, or an oracle. Considering that Jung developed the theory of the collective unconscious, and the notion of archetypes, having a collective god seems fitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The banner picture of this article is the cover of the 2nd volume of Book 3 in the Japanese paperback. In Japanese, “1Q84” and “1984” are both pronounced as “ichi-kew-hachi-yon”, that’s why this is written underneath the title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cover illustration for each volume is a detail of &lt;a href=&quot;https://archief.ntr.nl/tuinderlusten/en.html&quot;&gt;“The Garden of Earthly Delights” by Jheronimus Bosch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;Making bread is very easy if you take some care. You only need yeast, flour, water and salt. The whole process takes about four hours, but the total amount of active work is only half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from an oven, you will need the following items:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A recipient to mix your dough. It should hold least 2 or 3 l, for example a plastic pot or stainless steel cooking pot. I can strongly recommend the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lekue.com/eu/cookware/bread-maker-lekue.html&quot;&gt;Lekue Bread Maker&lt;/a&gt;, a silicone bread mould that can go straight into the oven.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A spoon or fork for mixing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Optional: a baking tin to shape your loaf. I use the Lekue for this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Optional: kitchen scales. Mine is a very plain model from Salter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this loaf you need only four ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3.5 g dried yeast (half a sachet)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;280 g water&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;400 g strong white wheat flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 g salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following ingredients are optional. I like to add some seeds, nuts and/or dried fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;25 g raisins or sultanas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;25 g chopped walnuts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a handful of sunflower seeds to put on top&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preparation&quot;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main difference between this recipe and the more common ones is the amount of water, which is considerably higher (most recipes say 200 ml for 400 g).  As a result, the dough is not as easy to knead and much more sticky.
This is why we use the “folding” technique as explained in the videos from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bakewithjack.co.uk/videos/2019/6/6/bread-tip-101-beginners-sourdough-loaf-start-to-finish&quot;&gt;Bake with Jack&lt;/a&gt;. Another great tip from that video is to sprinkle your hands with water instead of flour to stop the dough from sticking to them.
With the extra water the dough rises a lot better, so the result is a more open texture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add all ingredients to your mixing container&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mix thoroughly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knead for about ten to fifteen minutes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leave to rise in a cold oven. I put a tray with hot water in the oven and let the dough rise there, so it keeps warm and wet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After half an hour, fold the dough 12 times. “Folding” means that you pull on the dough, which is very elastic, and fold the pulled flap over the main ball of dough. The  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bakewithjack.co.uk/videos/2019/6/6/bread-tip-101-beginners-sourdough-loaf-start-to-finish&quot;&gt;Bake with Jack&lt;/a&gt;  video shows very clearly how to do this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leave for half an hour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fold 6 times; leave for half an hour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fold 6 times; leave for another half an hour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preheat the oven on 230 °C&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fold another 6 times&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As you can see from the picure, I sprinkled some sunflower seeds on top.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bake for 15 minutes at 230 °C. I put a small container with very hot water on the baking tray to get some steam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bake for another 30 minutes at 200 °C.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leave to cool on a rack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/sourdough-starter_1600.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;Making &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourdough&quot;&gt;sourdough&lt;/a&gt; bread is very easy if you take some care. The videos and blog from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bakewithjack.co.uk/videos/2019/6/6/bread-tip-101-beginners-sourdough-loaf-start-to-finish&quot;&gt;Bake with Jack&lt;/a&gt; helped me a lot.  In particular, I use his method for making the &lt;em&gt;sourdough starter&lt;/em&gt;, with only a minor tweak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;making-the-starter&quot;&gt;Making the starter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making a sourdough starter is very easy. Most recipes use wholemeal rye flour but I use wholemeal wheat flour which is a little less sour. This recipe is for 150 g sourdough starter, which is the amount I use for a single loaf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take a container of about 500 ml. I use a plastic mug with a lid, it does not have to close tightly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add 25 g flour and 25 g water at 35 °C, mix (I use the handle of spoon), leave for 24 hours at room temperature (20-25 °C; the warmer, the quicker).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeat for three consecutive days. It should roughly double in volume. If so, it’s ready to use; if not, leave it for another day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;feeding-the-starter&quot;&gt;Feeding the starter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have made this starter, keeping it going it is very simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you make your first loaf with a fresh starter, leave about 20 g starter in the container to make your next batch. I just keep this in the fridge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then, the day before I bake the next loaf, in the morning, add 75 g water  at 35 °C and 75 g flour to the container, stir well, and leave it at room temperature for a day. Put it in the fridge before you go to bed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The next day, take the started out of the fridge 3-4 hours before you start to bake.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Because you have now 170 g starter in the container, you can use 150 g for the loaf and then feed the starter again, for as long as you like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from an oven, you will need the following items:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A container of about 500 ml for the sourdough starter. I use a plastic mug with a lid, it does not have to close tightly. A glass jar is fine too.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A container of about 500 ml for water.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A spoon or fork for mixing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A recipient to mix your dough. It should hold least 2 or 3 l, for example a plastic pot or stainless steel cooking pot. I can strongly recommend the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lekue.com/eu/cookware/bread-maker-lekue.html&quot;&gt;Lekue Bread Maker&lt;/a&gt;, a silicone bread mould that can go straight into the oven.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Optional: a baking tin to shape your loaf.  With my recipe, the dough is quite wet so it does not keep its shape well. I use the Lekue for this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Optional: kitchen scales. Mine is a very plain model from Salter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Optional: a thermometer to make sure your water is at the right temperature. Not essential, but handy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between sourdough bread and ordinary bread is that you use a &lt;em&gt;sourdough starter&lt;/em&gt; instead of baking yeast. The great thing about a sourdough starter is that you can very easily make it yourself, from just flour and water. Have a look at  &lt;a href=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/recipes/sourdough-starter/&quot;&gt;my recipe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this loaf I only use four ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;150 g sourdough starter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;450 g water&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;675 g wholemeal wheat flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8 g salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preparation&quot;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First add 150 g starter to your mixing container.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then add 450 g water&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then add 675 g flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then add 8 g salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mix thoroughly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knead for about ten minutes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leave to rise in a cold oven. I put a tray with hot water in the oven and let the dough rise there, so it keeps warm and wet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After 30 minuts, fold the dough 12 times. “Folding” means that you pull on the dough, which is very elastic, and fold the pulled flap over the main ball of dough. The  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bakewithjack.co.uk/videos/2019/6/6/bread-tip-101-beginners-sourdough-loaf-start-to-finish&quot;&gt;Bake with Jack&lt;/a&gt;  video shows very clearly how to do this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leave for an hour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fold 6 times; leave for an hour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fold 6 times; leave for another hour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preheat the oven on 230 °C&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fold another 6 times&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As you can see from the picure, I sprinkled some pumpkin seeds on top.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bake for 20 minutes at 230 °C. I put a small container with very hot water on the baking tray to get some steam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bake for another 40 minutes at 200 °C.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leave to cool on a rack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually bake in the evening, and wrap the loaf in a towel overnight to keep the crust from drying out too much.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;I wrote a very short story for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.writersinkyoto.com/2019/12/writers-in-kyoto-present-the-fifth-annual-kyoto-writing-competition/&quot;&gt;Fifth Annual Kyoto Writing Competition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a href=&quot;www.dpri.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/&quot;&gt;Disaster Prevention Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; of Kyoto University, researchers are modelling the flow of the wind over the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wind that blows over the tiny machiyas of Gion and around Kyoto station with its tall hotels and the Tower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spring, it scatters a storm of sakura petals all over the city. In the rainy season, it blows down from Arashiyama along the waters of the Katsuragawa, and carries streams of clouds over the hills. When the temple ponds are full of lotus flowers, it stirs the lanterns and chases the incense smoke, and cools the faces of the teams that pull the Yamaboko along Shijou Doori. At the end of summer, when the higanbana is blooming, that same wind follows the railway line to Uji and blows in through the open window of the researchers’ offices, rifling the stacks of diagrams that reveal its very flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sometimes that flow gathers to a tremendous strength, and then a typhoon will lacerate the city. The models of the wind predicts this, to make sure the people of Kyoto are prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Kyoto hunkers down, and waits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the storm has passed, the sky is a transparent clear and blue. The wind of Kyoto is once again cool and mild, blowing gently over the city.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/ghost-in-the-shell-puppets_1600x600.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;Ghost in the Shell is a series of Japanese animated movies (&lt;em&gt;anime&lt;/em&gt;,アニメ) featuring cyborgs (“cybernetic organism”, in this case a  human with both organic and robotic body parts). I was struck by the frequent references to puppets in several of the movies, and I want to explore the symbolism behind this.
I will look in particular at the movies “Ghost in the Shell”, “Innocence” and “Solid State Society”, because in these movies the references are most clear. Familiarity with the movies is not required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;puppets-dolls-marionettes-mannequins&quot;&gt;Puppets, dolls, marionettes, mannequins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the word puppet as the most general word. A doll to my mind is a puppet used as a child’s toy. A marionette is a puppet with strings to manipulate it. And a mannequin is a puppet in the sense that it is a representation of a human. I would say that the crucial property is that a puppet is somewhat articulated or can be made to move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Japanese there are also several words for puppets and dolls.
The most common word is &lt;em&gt;ningyō&lt;/em&gt;, 人形 , “doll, puppet”. The word &lt;em&gt;nin&lt;/em&gt; means person and &lt;em&gt;gyō&lt;/em&gt; means form, shape.
Specifically, &lt;em&gt;ayatsuriningyō&lt;/em&gt;, 操り人形, sometimes shortened to just &lt;em&gt;ayatsuri&lt;/em&gt;, 操り, means a puppet controlled by an operator, e.g. a marionette. The word &lt;em&gt;ayatsuri&lt;/em&gt; means “manipulation”. The other word that is used in Ghost in the Shell is &lt;em&gt;kairai&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;kugutsu&lt;/em&gt;, 傀儡, this is an older word and not so common (neither of the kanji is in common use). It is an interesting word because both its characters mean “puppet”. The first, 傀, is composed of “person” and “ghost”; the second is likely simply a variant, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%82%80%E5%84%A1#Japanese&quot;&gt;is only used in this word&lt;/a&gt;. The reading &lt;em&gt;kugutsu&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%82%80%E5%84%A1%E5%AD%90-55054&quot;&gt;apparently&lt;/a&gt; derives from &lt;em&gt;kugu&lt;/em&gt;, 久具, a plant from which the baskets were woven that were used to transport the puppets by itinerant puppet players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cyberbrains-and-ghosts&quot;&gt;Cyberbrains and ghosts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Ghost in the Shell series, one of the main themes that is being explored is what defines a human. A cyborg is a human with all or parts of its body replaced by artificial components. In the Ghost in the Shell universe, even the brain can be treated this way, being augmented by a cyberbrain (&lt;em&gt;dennō&lt;/em&gt;,電脳), essentially an electronic system with a similar functionality, but connected to the net).
In the most extreme case, the entire human brain is replaced by a cyberbrain which contains the content of the original human brain.
By contrast, robots do not start out human. The difference between a robot and a full-cyborg human is only the origin of the data in the brain.
In Ghost in the Shell, the word ghost is colloquial slang for an individual’s consciousness or soul, which is what sets it apart from a robot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the plot of the second movie, “Innocence”, is that robots get a ghost through a process called “ghost dubbing”, i.e. copying the ghost from a human and putting it into the robot cyberbrain. This idea returns in the recent “Arise” series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-brief-note-on-the-characters&quot;&gt;A brief note on the characters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article I will mention a few characters from the series who belong to a kind of special state intelligence unit called “Public Security Section 9” (公安９課):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“The Major”, Motoko Kusanagi, a female cyborg, the main character in the series.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Batō, a male cyborg, the protagonist in “Innocence”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Togusa, a human with a cyberbrain, the companion of Batō in “Innocence”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I mention a character from “The Individual Eleven” series, Hideo Kuze, a male cyborg, a very charismatic revolutionary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ghost-in-the-shell-1995&quot;&gt;Ghost in the Shell (1995)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first Ghost in the Shell movie, there is no strong symbolism of puppets, but there are several references.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Project 2501&lt;/em&gt; is a program that can stealthily manipulate politics and intelligence, altering databases and the memories in people’s cyberbrains. While traversing the net as it performed its tasks, Project 2501 acquired and processed so much information that it eventually achieved self-awareness. Its creators regarded this as a bug in the program. When Project 2501 realised that its programmers would try to kill it when they discovered it had become sentient, it devised a plan to ensure its own safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the manipulations of Project 2501 are discovered, they are initially assumed to be the work of an extremely skilled hacker, nicknamed the Puppet Master (人形使い,&lt;em&gt;ningyoutsukai&lt;/em&gt;), presumably because it is a master manipulator and the people whose cyberbrains are hacked become effectively sock puppets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth nothing that at the end of the movie, Project 2501 is assimilated into the cyberbrain of Motoko Kusanagi. So from a certain angle Kusanagi becomes the Puppet Master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more oblique but to my mind more important puppet reference is the scene where Motoko Kusanagi rides on a passenger boat on the canals of Hong Kong. This is a long montage without dialogue. Kusanagi sees someone very much like herself at a table in a restaurant. Is it a human or a cyborg? She also looks at some mannequins in a shop window, and the scene ends with an empty shop with undressed, partially disassembled mannequins. You can’t help but think about how she must see a parallel between herself and these puppets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;innocence-2004&quot;&gt;Innocence (2004)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second Ghost in the Shell movie, “Innocence”, is where the puppet symbolism is present most strongly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reference to puppets in Ghost in the Shell “Innocence” is an implicit one: the title song is called the Puppet Song, of which I wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;http://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/articles/ghost-in-the-shell-manyoshi/&quot;&gt;an earlier article&lt;/a&gt;. The full title of the song is &lt;em&gt;kugutsu-uta: uramite chiru&lt;/em&gt; (傀儡謡「怨恨みて 散る」, くぐつうた「うらみてちる」) which means “Puppet song: The flowers resentfully fall”. The theme of the song is mortality. It is used a few times in the movie, but most prominently in the opening scene, which shows the creation of a humanoid robot, and in the parade scene, which is based on a Taiwanese Buddhist temple procession and involves giant puppet-like figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another reference, one that I found particularly interesting. After the parade scene, Togusa sees the following poem written on a wall:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;落一棚生&lt;br /&gt;
落線頭死&lt;br /&gt;
磊断傀去&lt;br /&gt;
磊時儡来&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writing order is top to bottom, right to left, and it is an archaic and poetic form of Japanese without hiragana. Togusa reads it in full as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;生死の去来するは、&lt;br /&gt;
棚頭の傀儡たり。&lt;br /&gt;
一線断ゆる時、&lt;br /&gt;
落落磊磊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;せいしのきょらいするは、&lt;br /&gt;
ほうとうのかいらいたり、&amp;lt;b
いっせんたゆるとき、&lt;br /&gt;
らくらくらいらい&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;seishi no kyorai suru wa,&lt;br /&gt;
hōtō no kairai tari,&lt;br /&gt;
issen tayuru toki,&lt;br /&gt;
rakuraku rairai.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the dubbed version, this is translated as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Life and death come and go&lt;br /&gt;
like marionettes dancing on a table.&lt;br /&gt;
Once their strings are cut,&lt;br /&gt;
they easily crumble.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;rakuraku rairai&lt;/em&gt; is particularly poetic. &lt;em&gt;raku&lt;/em&gt; means&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to fall down; &lt;em&gt;rai&lt;/em&gt; means a heap of stones, the kanj&amp;lt;i 磊 is stone 石 repeated three times. Hence the overall meaning of crumble. Curiously, the word 磊磊落落 (&lt;em&gt;rairairakuraku&lt;/em&gt;) also exists; it means “openhearted; unaffected; free and easy”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original author of this poem is a Buddhist monk called Getsuan Soukou (月庵宗光), who lived 1326－1389, during the The Nanboku-chō period (南北朝時代). He used it in one of his sermons.
The poem got included in a famous treatise on Noh theatre, “A Mirror of the Flower” (Kakyō, 花鏡) by Zeami Motokiyo (世阿弥 元清) (1363–1443), who was the son of Kan’ami Kiyotsugu. Together they are considered the founders of Noh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noh theatre is a form of classical Japanese theatre with music, poetry and dance. It is still regularly performed today, and has a similar status to opera in Western society. In Ghost in the Shell there are occasional references to Noh, in particular in “The Individual Eleven” where Hideo Kuze has a lengthy monologue about the origins of Noh and how it was cherished by the samurai class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zeami’s work “A Mirror of the Flower” deals amongst other topics with the link between marionettes and Noh theatre actors. The work &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2384167&quot;&gt;has been translated into English (and you can read it for free)&lt;/a&gt; and I found in it a closer (and perhaps better) translation of the poem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Birth and death, goings and comings:&lt;br /&gt;
A marionette in play.&lt;br /&gt;
When one string snaps,&lt;br /&gt;
It falls and collapses.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comment by Zeami is quite interesting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This [poem] exemplifies the condition of humans who act out the cycle of birth-and-death. Although the manipulation of an artificial figure upon the boards [of a puppet stage] may [make it] appear as all sorts of things, it is not really an object that moves [of its own will]. It is [the result of] the play of manipulated strings. Cut these strings and it collapses – such is the spirit [of this poem].”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also an interesting footnote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This poem appears in Gettan Osho Hogo (月庵和尚法語,’[Rinzai Zen] Priest Gettan’s Talks on Buddhist Principles’), a late 14th-century text. Zeami’s subsequent interpretation of the poem as descriptive of the relation between the actor’s mind and the ‘illusion’ of character that it creates differs from the Zen intent of
the poem, which admonishes the reader to break free from the trap of the illusory world of ‘birth-and-death’.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But considering the argument presented before the poem, what Zeami means is that as soon as the actor loses this ultimate state of awareness, the acting will collapse.
Zeami argues that when the actor achieves the ultimate state of awareness, he realizes how his mind can be used to create the illusion of reality that he presents to his audience with a detachment and skill associated with a master puppeteer. In other words, the actor on the stage is the puppet manipulated by the actor’s mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very powerful concept, and closely related to the type of Buddhist meditation that focuses on existing in the moment. It is likely also why Noh appealed to the samurai. Within the context of Ghost in the Shell, this concept gets an extended meaning, not restricted to the mind and body of a human. Any self-aware entity controlling a humanoid form can be considered in this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is why this poem figures so prominently in the movie, but specifically in the scenes to do with the place where the robots are created (Etorofu, one of the Kuril Islands). The two main characters, Batō and Togusa, go there to interview a powerful hacker, Kim, who is obsessed with dolls and clockwork and who has transfered his own ghost into a puppet-like robot. Clearly, Kim is the one fascinated by this poem, as every appearance of it is connected to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generalizing Zeami’s view of the poem, I am inclined to interpret the strings in the poem as the connection between the robots and the mind that controls them. In a key scene, the protagonist Batō enters the factory ship where the robots are made. He is attacked by an army of robots programmed remotely to fight him.
Motoko Kusanagi hacks one of them and downloads her ghost into it, and fights on his side. She then gains control of the ship’s central computer, at which point all the robots except the one she controls collapse: their threads have been cut. This is a recurrent theme in Ghost in the Shell, for example in “Solid State Society” something very similar happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps more significant is the fact that to Batō, who clearly has missed the Major deeply since she disappeared at the end of the first movie, three years ago, immediately identifies the robot with her. As the robots on the ship are not dressed, he puts his jacket on her. And this despite the fact that the robot has no facial expression and looks identical to the others. When the Major disconnects from the robot, it also collapses. But Batō now knows that the ghost of the Major is always around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as if not to leave any doubt about the importance of the puppets in the movie, the final scene ends with a close-up of a doll held by Togusa’s daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/doll.png&quot; alt=&quot;Close-up of a child's doll with blond hair, blue eyes and a red hat&quot; title=&quot;Close-up of a child's doll with blond hair, blue eyes and a red hat&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ghost-in-the-shell-stand-alone-complex--solid-state-society-2006&quot;&gt;Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex – Solid State Society (2006)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right at the start of this third movie, there is a reference to “the Puppet Master”. The Major listens in to a conversation where the nickname is used, and comments “The Puppet Master? Not a bad name!”. Note that in Japanese the word is different from in the first movie: instead of &lt;em&gt;ningyōtsukai&lt;/em&gt; 人形遣い it is &lt;em&gt;kugutsumawashi&lt;/em&gt; 傀儡廻; &lt;em&gt;kugutsu&lt;/em&gt; is a different reading for &lt;em&gt;kairai&lt;/em&gt;, 傀儡, the word for puppet used in the poem in Innocence. The word &lt;em&gt;mawashi&lt;/em&gt;, 廻, means “to go around”, and &lt;em&gt;kugutsumawashi&lt;/em&gt; refers to wandering puppet players who went from village to village. Because of the different word choice, it is in the original Japanese version less obvious that there could be a link with the Puppet Master in the first movie.There is a however a clear link with the second movie because of the word &lt;em&gt;kugutsu&lt;/em&gt;, which is lost in the English version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in the first movie, the initial assumption is that this Puppet Master must be some top-wizard-level hacker (超ウィザード級ハッカー); then the suspicion grows that it might be some distributed program which might have achieved some degree of self-awareness. But considering the first movie, it should come as no surprise that there is a connection with the Major.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on we see the Major operating many different cyber bodies remotely, even several at once. At one point, she tries to control one too many and one of them collapses, and she remarks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同時に義体を操るのは、2体迄が限界ね&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;tōji ni gitai wo ayatsuru no wa, nitai made ga genkai ne&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English subtitles say “Controlling two prosthetic bodies at the same time is apparently my limit”. The word &lt;em&gt;gitai&lt;/em&gt;,義体, is closer translated as cyber body; the word used for controlling is &lt;em&gt;ayatsuru&lt;/em&gt;,操る, exactly the word for manipulating a puppet. And there is a scene where one of the Major’s remote cyber bodies deactivates during a conversation, leading the person talking to it to comment, “Huh, that’s a puppet as well?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also appears on the wall of Kim’s study:&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">
        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/naginata-hoko-kitsune_1600x600.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/articles/ran-ryou-ou/&quot;&gt;written earlier&lt;/a&gt; about a drawing I made of a dancer at the Gion Matsuri in Kyoto. I made another drawing, this time based on a pictures I took of musicians on a festival float. I’d like to share the background to and the making of the drawing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-gion-matsuri&quot;&gt;The Gion Matsuri&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gion Matsuri (祇園祭) is Kyoto’s most famous festival, held at the start of summer.  The festival itself can be dated back all the way to the Heian era, around 870.  It originated as a ritual for purification and pacification of evil spirits causing summer diseases and was at first connected with the Shintō deity of the Gion Shrine (Yasaka Shrine).
The festival has been held annually since 970. As early as the late 10th century two types of floats were paraded through the streets accompanied by musicians, dancers, and actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Edo period (1600 to 1868) the matsuri became a way in which merchants could show off their wealth as well as their international outlook. In that period, the decoration of the floats became more detailed and luxurious and many started incorporating foreign artwork. In particular cotton merchants were among the parishioners of the Gion Shrine, so that textiles have always formed an important part of the festival decoration. The floats currently used in the parade mostly date from the end of the Edo era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-yamaboko-float-parade&quot;&gt;The Yamaboko float parade&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the morning of 17 July there is a parade (&lt;em&gt;junkō&lt;/em&gt;, 巡行) of festival floats through the streets of the city. There are two float types, &lt;em&gt;yama&lt;/em&gt; (山, meaning “mountain” but also “festival float”) and &lt;em&gt;hoko&lt;/em&gt; (鉾, meaning both “festival float” and “halberd”), hence the name &lt;em&gt;yamaboko junkō&lt;/em&gt; (山鉾巡行).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-koi-yama&quot;&gt;The Koi Yama&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;yama&lt;/em&gt; is a rectangular box containing an artificial mountain crowned by a tree, usually a pine. Textiles decorate the four sides. This type of float is carried through the streets on the shoulders of young men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to mention one of these &lt;em&gt;yama&lt;/em&gt; in particular, although it has nothing to do with my drawing. The &lt;em&gt;koi yama&lt;/em&gt; (鯉山, “carp float”) features a huge carp swimming upstream towards the sky. This refers to the Chinese legend about a carp who desired to become a dragon and had to go through many trials to reach the Dragon Gate Waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is particularly interesting about the Koi Yama float are the decorations: they consist of parts of an authentic 16th-century Flemish tapestry depicting scenes of the Trojan War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was quite a surprise to me to find a Flemish tapestry decorating a festival float in Kyoto. So I wanted to find out more, and this is the story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 16th century, Flemish tapestries were luxury items coveted throughout Europe, and common as diplomatic gifts. The Japanese nobles were particularly interested in images of warriors [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/3050146&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Koi Yama tapestry was part of a set of six created by the atelier of the Flemish weaver Nicaise Aerts in Brussels in the 1590s, probably based on cartoons by the famous Michel Coxie. There are different theories of how they came to Japan.
The could have been brought to Japan by the Portuguese on request of the Jesuits around 1605 [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/3050146&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;] as a gift to the first Tokugawa shōgun Ieyasu, or by the Netherlands East India Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie; VOC) in 1633 [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iassrt.org/detail/symposium/154.html&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;], as a diplomatic gift to the third Tokugawa shōgun Iemitsu. Or maybe they could have been gifts from Pope Paolo V to daimyō Date Masamune’s diplomatic/trade mission to Europe, and entered Japan as contraband just as the Tokugawa shōgun closed Japan to limit foreign influence (in 1633) [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gionfestival.org/koi-yama/&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, when the power moved from the shōguns to the merchant classes, the tapestries were sold on. One was lost early on and one during a fire in 1909, but the other four, though mostly cut up, still survive. Around 1800,  one of them was acquired to serve as decoration for the Koi Yama, and cut into nine pieces using “a carpenter’s chisel” (&lt;em&gt;daiku no nomi&lt;/em&gt;, 大工のノミ) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.koiyama.com/index2.html&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some dispute as to the scenes depicted on the Koi Yama tapestries, as indeed on the other tapestries in the set: some scholars say they are from the Illiad, and show King Priam and Queen Hecuba [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.koiyama.com/index2.html&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]; others say the set is based on the Aeneid and that the Koi Yama tapestry shows the Roman emperor Augustus, the descendant of Aeneas [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/3050146&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-naginata-hoko&quot;&gt;The Naginata Hoko&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;hoko&lt;/em&gt; is a tall, rectangular tower with a steepled roof, placed on huge wooden wheels. Underneath the roof there is room for musicians and actors, or dolls representing heroes and heroines from the legendary or historical past. All four sides of the tower are hung with textiles. This type of float is pulled through the streets by teams of thirty to forty men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 32 floats in the Yamaboko Junko, and each year their order is decided by lots drawn officially by the Mayor of Kyoto, except for one: the Naginata Hoko (長刀鉾) always leads the procession. The name comes from the &lt;em&gt;naginata&lt;/em&gt;, a long sword or halberd, that decorates its central pole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legendary Heian swordsmith &lt;a href=&quot;https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%89%E6%9D%A1%E5%AE%97%E8%BF%91&quot;&gt;Sanjō Munechika (Sanjō no Kokaji)&lt;/a&gt; crafted the original halberd sword in the 10th century. The halberd is said to have the power to exorcise the evil spirits which cause epidemics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was at the &lt;em&gt;yoiyama&lt;/em&gt; (宵山, the day before the parade) in 2012 I took a few pictures of musicians in a &lt;em&gt;hoko&lt;/em&gt;, and it was only when I decided to make a drawing based on it that I realised this is not just a float, but the famous Naginata Hoko. There is a lot more to be said about this particular float, I have provided some links below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kitsune-masks-and-yukata&quot;&gt;Kitsune masks and yukata&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to give the characters in the drawing fox masks to make the scene more distinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fox masks (&lt;em&gt;kitsune men&lt;/em&gt;, 狐面) have a long tradition in Japan. In Shinto, the fox is a messenger of the god (&lt;em&gt;kami&lt;/em&gt;, 神) Inari, who is the protector of rice, agriculture, and fertility. The gods themselves can take on fox shapes. The mask are use in Noh, Shinto music and dance (&lt;em&gt;kagura&lt;/em&gt;, 神楽) and &lt;em&gt;kabuki&lt;/em&gt; performances and worn at many festivals – and of course &lt;a href=&quot;https://hooktube.com/watch?v=cK3NMZAUKGw&quot;&gt;by Babymetal’s Kami band&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was particularly inspired by the mask worn by the character Gin in the wonderful anime &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hotarubi.info/gallery/tr05.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hotarubi no Mori e&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (蛍火の杜へ, “To the Forest of the Light of the Fireflies”), but I researched other mask variants as well, in particular because the musicians have to wear half-masks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The musicians in my drawing wear the same summer kimonos (&lt;em&gt;yukata&lt;/em&gt;) as in the picture, save a few minor details, but for the other characters I used different patterns based on other pictures I took.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/articles/ran-ryou-ou/&quot;&gt;Ranryōō dancer drawing&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted a drawing with bright colours and a lot of detail, and the float has really abundant detail and colour. It is quite amazing how every part of the surface has some detailed decoration. I think I now appreciate the float a lot more because to draw it I had to study every little detail in the picture. I also like to have human figures in my drawings. I think the fox masks make the scene more interesting than the original picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper for this drawing is Fabriano Artistico 56cm x 76cm 300g/m2 “rough” watercolour paper. It’s a really nice paper with a very pronounced grain. As usual I did not tape it on a board but it only buckled a little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used mainly Derwent Inktense, which do give quite deep colours, but also Conté Aquarelle and Faber-Castell Graphite Aquarelle pencils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual I started the drawing with a ghost drawing in pencil. Because of the size of the drawing, I used a grid to make sure the figure was positioned correctly. The focus of detail is on the characters and in particular the masks, the further away from these the more sketchy and impressionistic I treated the drawing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Pencil ghost drawing detail, start of colouring&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I added detail and colour with the watercolour pencils. The float has a lot of gold and silver on the hangings, and these are very difficult to render in colour pencil. The level of details is such that to really reproduce it would require very smooth paper and very fine brushes. I picked the coarse paper on purpose and the pencils are not particularly sharp. This forces me to abstract a lot of the detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/gion-matsuri-float-musicians-colour-pencil-detail-1280px.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;the drawing&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;First layer of detail and colour&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I did some separate sketches for the non-musician characters, because they are to my mind very important in this drawing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/gion-matsuri-float-musicians-sep-detail-1280px.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;the drawing&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Separate drawing of non-musician characters&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left the characters until the end and washed the watercolours starting from the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/gion-matsuri-float-musicians-almost-finished-1280px.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;the drawing&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Partially washed drawing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I did the characters. The eyes on the masks are the only places where I used a very fine brush, because a tiny change in the shape can make a big change in expression. Then I did another pass of the entire drawing. I darkened the background behind the characters and the ceiling to have more contrast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To finish the drawing I added a description in Japanese:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;狐 長 祇&lt;br /&gt;
  の 刀 園&lt;br /&gt;
  面 鉾 祭&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which reads &lt;em&gt;Gion matsuri naginata hoko kitsune no men&lt;/em&gt; and means “Gion festival / Halberd float / Fox masks”. The “の” is not really required but I wanted the characters to form a 3x3 grid.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;This recipe is inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kawalingpinoy.com/curried-okra-with-tomatoes/&quot;&gt;Curried okra with tomatoes&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kawalingpinoy.com&quot;&gt;Kawaling Pinoy&lt;/a&gt; Filipino recipe site.
I added &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.waiyeehong.com/food-ingredients/dried-products/dried-beancurd-seaweed/dried-beancurd-sticks-tofu-bamboo-2?language=tw&quot;&gt;tofu (bean curd) sticks&lt;/a&gt; and used more tomatoes; also the spices are a bit different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes a bit longer because I used Japanese short-grained brown rice (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.japancentre.com/en/products/3274-yumenishiki-brown-rice&quot;&gt;Yumenishiki Brown Rice&lt;/a&gt;, grown in Italy) and that takes longer to cook than white rice. The actual preparation time is about 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For two people:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fresh ingredients &amp;amp; groceries
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;300g fresh or frozen okra (I could only find frozen)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;2 large tomatoes, chopped&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;50 g dried tofu sticks&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;2 cm fresh ginger, finely chopped&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;2 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;1/2 cup water&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From the store cupboard
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;1 cup of rice (I used brown Japanese rice)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons sesame seeds&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon ground turmeric&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon ground coriander&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon ground cumin&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;1/4 teaspoon &lt;em&gt;tobanjan&lt;/em&gt; (or a pinch of chilli powder)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon &lt;em&gt;miso&lt;/em&gt; paste&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon &lt;em&gt;yuzu&lt;/em&gt; juice (you can use lemon, lime or even vinegar as substitute)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon rapeseed oil or other cooking oil&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preparation&quot;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soak the tofu sticks in very hot water for 30 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meanwhile
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Cook the rice (as it is wholegrain rice, it takes rather long, up to 45 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Cook the okra 6 minutes (4 minutes for fresh okra) in the microwave at full power (900W), stir every 2 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Heat the oil in a deep pan. When the oil is hot, add the ginger, garlic, sesame seeds and spices and fry for a few minutes over medium heat.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Drain the tofu sticks and cut them into pieces.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Add the tofu sticks to the pan and cook until lightly browned.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Add the tomatoes, okra, &lt;em&gt;miso&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;tobanjan&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;yuzu&lt;/em&gt; juice and cook, stirring occasionally, for a few minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Add the water and let it simmer for another 10 minutes or so.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Serve with the rice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;In October I went on a research retreat in Greece. The food was delicious. Celeste from Artisa, who runs the retreat, is an excellent cook and by popular demand she &lt;a href=&quot;https://artisagreece.org/artisa-food-cookbook-with-delicious-vegetarian-meals/&quot;&gt;published a cookbook&lt;/a&gt;. This recipe is my adaptation of Celeste’s recipe for “Fasolakia ladera” (Φασολάκια λαδερά), green beans in tomato sauce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;post-tag&quot; href=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/tags/#vegetarian&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;vegetarian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a class=&quot;post-tag&quot; href=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/tags/#45-minutes&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;45-minutes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  • &lt;em&gt;750 kcal per person&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/tags/#600-800kcals&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/battery_lvl_3.png&quot; style=&quot;height:1.0em;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For two people:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fresh ingredients &amp;amp; groceries
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;375 g green beans (I used stringless runner beans)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;4 small potatoes (150 g)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;2 cm ginger, finely chopped&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;2 large beef tomatoes (300 g)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;half a cup of fresh mint leaves&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From the store cupboard
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;1 cup rice (I used Basmati)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;4 tablespoons tomato puree&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon sugar&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon pine kernels&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon garlic oil&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;4 tablespoons olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;salt and pepper to taste (I added 1/4 teaspoon salt, and sprinkled some pepper on serving)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preparation&quot;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wash the tomatoes, chop them fine and cook them in a large pot in the microwave for 5 minutes at full power (900W). Stir and cook for another 5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meanwhile,
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Cook the rice (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/basics/#toc0&quot;&gt;“The Basics”&lt;/a&gt; for how to cook rice).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Wash and clean the beans and break them in two or three pieces.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Wash the potatoes and cut them in 4 pieces (no need to peel them).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Heat the olive oil and garlic oil in a large deep pan and stir-fry the ginger and beans for about 5 minutes over high heat.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Add the pine kernels at the end and fry for another minute or so until they start to brown. Take care as they burn very easily.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add the content of the pan to the pot with the tomatoes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add the potatoes, the tomato puree and the sugar.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cook in the microwave for 5 minutes at full power (900W).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add the fresh mint leaves.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cook in the microwave for a further 5 minutes at full power (900W), and then 5 minutes are reduced power (300 W).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leave the dish for a few minutes before serving.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cut the feta in thick slices, season with olive oil and oregano.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Serve with the feta and rice and season with pepper to taste.&lt;/li&gt;

        <content type="html">
        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://quickandtastycooking.org.uk/images/ghost-in-the-shell-manyoshi_1600x600.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;The first “Ghost in the Shell” anime has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTPNaUsjksM&quot;&gt;a very striking opening theme&lt;/a&gt;. It was expanded for the second movie, “Innocence”. I was in particular intrigued by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOEEfPpSAZ8&quot;&gt;the “Puppet Song”&lt;/a&gt; in Innocence, and tried to unwrap the many layers behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ghost-in-the-shell&quot;&gt;Ghost in the Shell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1995, the first “Ghost in the Shell” anime was released, based on the 1991 manga &lt;em&gt;koukaku kidoutai&lt;/em&gt; (攻殻機動隊, “mobile armoured riot police”) by Shirō Masamune. It’s a cyberpunk, near-future science fiction anime about cyborgs and to my mind it deals with the question of what makes a human human. It is one of my favourite anime, and one of the reasons for this is the score by Kenji Kawai. In particular, the film has a very striking opening theme sung by a choir, “謡I - Making of Cyborg”. The character 謡 (&lt;em&gt;uta&lt;/em&gt;) indicates that the song is a traditional folk ballad or chant, otherwise the more common character for “song”  歌 (also &lt;em&gt;uta&lt;/em&gt;) would be used. There are three of these chants in the movie, but I want to focus on the first one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-of-cyborg&quot;&gt;Making of Cyborg&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjOuEruzoh0&quot;&gt;listening to this song&lt;/a&gt;, what struck me is that it sounds similar to the choral songs of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFgzzWT3zX4&quot;&gt;“Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares”&lt;/a&gt;, which was the name of a 1975 recording of Bulgarian folk songs performed by the Bulgarian State Radio &amp;amp; Television Female Vocal Choir. It only became widely known after being re-released by the British independent record label 4AD in 1986.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, this is not a coincidence: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/interview-kenji-kawai-talks-unique-video-game-film-soundtrack-experiences&quot;&gt;in an interview&lt;/a&gt;, the composer explained he had wanted a chorus in Bulgarian style but using Japanese folk singers. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A4%E3%83%8E%E3%82%BB%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B9&quot;&gt;the Japanese Wiki&lt;/a&gt;, he used only three singers for the recording. The result is a very interesting combination of a traditional Bulgarian mode with Japanese lyrics and singing style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is also very interesting is the nature of the song: it is intended to be similar to a traditional Japanese wedding song, but as far as I could gather the composer wrote the lyrics. He used a very archaic style, dating back to the Heian period (794 to 1185, when Kyoto became the capital) or even the earlier Nara period (710 to 794, when Nara was the capital).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original lyrics are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吾が舞へば&lt;br /&gt;
麗し女　酔ひにけり&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吾が舞へば　&lt;br /&gt;
照る月　響むなり&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;結婚に　神降りて&lt;br /&gt;
夜は明け　鵺鳥　鳴く&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;hiragana&lt;/em&gt; this reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;あがまへば&lt;br /&gt;
くわしめ　よひにけり&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;あがまへば&lt;br /&gt;
てるつき　とよむなり&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;よばいに　かみあまくだりて&lt;br /&gt;
よはあけ　ぬえとりなく&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in &lt;em&gt;romaji&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;agamaeba&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;kuwashime yoinikeri&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;agamaeba&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;terutsuki toyomunari&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;yobai ni amakudarite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;yo wa ake nuetori naku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I based my translation on &lt;a href=&quot;https://ameblo.jp/mazdafamilia2010/entry-11170063067.html&quot;&gt;a modern Japanese version&lt;/a&gt; of the archaic Japanese:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;私が舞うと　
美しい女が酔った&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;私が舞うと　
照る月が　鳴り響く&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;結婚するために　神が天から　降りてきて
夜が明けて　鵺鳥が　鳴く&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My translation is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As I dance, the beautiful woman is enchanted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;As I dance, the shining moon reverberates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The god descends from heaven to get married&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The night turns into day and the thrush cries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last words in the song quite dramatically change the atmosphere because of the negative connotations of the cry of the &lt;em&gt;nue&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“to get married”: the word used in the song is &lt;em&gt;yobai ni&lt;/em&gt;, where &lt;em&gt;yo&lt;/em&gt; (夜) means “night” and &lt;em&gt;bai&lt;/em&gt; (這い) “to crawl”. In the Heian era, a nobleman sneaking into a lady’s bedroom at night constituted a marriage proposal. There are many examples in the famous novel &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_Genji&quot;&gt;The Tale of Genji&lt;/a&gt;. The lyrics in kanji above have “結婚に” (&lt;em&gt;kekkon ni&lt;/em&gt;)  which means to get married.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“The thrush cries”: the specific bird is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White's_thrush&quot;&gt;White’s Thrush&lt;/a&gt;. Nowadays, 鵺 &lt;em&gt;nue&lt;/em&gt; also refers to a mythological creature, a Japanese version of the chimaera, but that was not the case in the Heian era. Nevertheless, the cry of this bird is an ill omen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;innocence&quot;&gt;Innocence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2004, the second Ghost in the Shell anime, “Innocence”, was released, with the same director (Mamoru Oshii) and continuing the themes from the first movie but with a much more explicit exploration of the philosophical themes through quotes and imagery. Also there are more pronounced archaic elements, for example sometimes the characters use archaic Japanese, and of course there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtxRCwZH-OA&quot;&gt;the famous parade scene&lt;/a&gt;. I think this anime is a masterpiece. But my focus is again only on the opening theme song, the Puppet Song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-puppet-song-i&quot;&gt;The Puppet Song (I)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full title of the song is &lt;em&gt;kugutsu-uta: uramite chiru&lt;/em&gt; (傀儡謡「怨恨みて 散る」, くぐつうた「うらみてちる」) which means “Puppet song: The flowers resentfully fall” (the word “flowers” is not present in the title but implicit from the lyrics). A translation I found in many places is “The flowers grieve and fall” but 怨恨 is not grief but resentment, even hate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The song is in the same choral mode as “Making of Cyborg”. The harmony and delivery are also quite similar but the melody is distinctly different. Musically, another notable difference is that the composer expanded the choir from three singers to 75. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqGq2QgDQR8&quot;&gt;live performance of this song with the full choir&lt;/a&gt; is very impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lyrics are written in a similar archaic style, but they are longer and a lot less straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original lyrics are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;一日一夜に　&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~sg2h-ymst/yamatouta/sennin/kawati_t.html&quot;&gt;月は照らずとも&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
悲傷しみに　鵺鳥　鳴く&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://manapedia.jp/text/1659&quot;&gt;吾がかへり 見すれど&lt;/a&gt;　&lt;a href=&quot;https://art-tags.net/manyo/five/m0798.html&quot;&gt;花は散りぬべし&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://manyou.plabot.michikusa.jp/manyousyu5_898.html&quot;&gt;慰むる　心は&lt;/a&gt;　&lt;a href=&quot;https://art-tags.net/manyo/twelve/m3039.html&quot;&gt;消ぬるがごとく&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;新世に　神集いて&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://art-tags.net/manyo/fifteen/m3598.html&quot;&gt;夜は明け&lt;/a&gt;　鵺鳥　鳴く&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;咲く花は　&lt;a href=&quot;http://k-amc.kokugakuin.ac.jp/DM/detail.do?class_name=col_dsg&amp;amp;data_id=68283&quot;&gt;神に祈ひ祷む&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://manyou.plabot.michikusa.jp/manyousyu4_746.html&quot;&gt;生ける世に&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://manapedia.jp/text/2077&quot;&gt;吾が身悲しも&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
夢は 消ぬ&lt;br /&gt;
怨恨みて&lt;br /&gt;
散る&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;hiragana&lt;/em&gt; this reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ひとひひとよに　つきはてらずとも&lt;br /&gt;
かなしみに　ぬえとり　なく&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;あがかへり　みすれど　はなはちりぬべし&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;なぐさむる　こころは　けぬるがごとく&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;あらたよに　かむつどいて&lt;br /&gt;
よはあけ　ぬえとりなく&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;さくはなは　かみにこひのむ&lt;br /&gt;
いけるよに&lt;br /&gt;
わがみかなしも　&lt;br /&gt;
いめは　けぬ&lt;br /&gt;
うらみて&lt;br /&gt;
ちる&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in &lt;em&gt;romaji&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;hitohi hitoyo ni tsuki wa terazu to mo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;kanashimi ni nuetori naku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;agakaeri misuredo hana wa chirinubeshi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;nagusamuru kokoro wa kenuru ga godoku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;arata yo ni kamu tsudoite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;yo wa ake nuetori naku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;sakuhana wa kami ni kohinomu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;ikeru yo ni&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;wa ga mi kanashi mo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;ime wa kenu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;uramite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;chiru&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I tried to read and understand this text, I got stuck on almost every single line. I was quite surprised to find that almost all the parts that I did not understand occur in the Manyōshū.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-manyōshū&quot;&gt;The Manyōshū&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Manyōshū&lt;/em&gt; (万葉集), literally “Collection of Myriad Leaves”, is the oldest existing collection of poetry in classical Japanese, compiled during the Nara period. It is extremely highly regarded, for example the name of the current era, 令和 (&lt;em&gt;reiwa&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;https://japan-forward.com/manyoshu-know-the-poetry-collection-where-japans-new-era-name-comes-from/&quot;&gt;was inspired by one of its poems&lt;/a&gt;. It has been studied by scholars for a very long time, and therefore it is possible to find explanations and translations of the poems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-puppet-song-ii&quot;&gt;The Puppet Song (II)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the original lyrics of the Puppet Song above, each linked phrase occurs in a poem from the &lt;em&gt;Manyōshū&lt;/em&gt; collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s quite remarkable that the lyrics of the theme song of a cyberpunk science fiction anime are so strongly inspired by 7th-century classical Japanese poetry. I am also intrigued how the composer could write in such an archaic style, which I assume only very few people master today. And of course this explains why I did not understand so many of the lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, thanks to the Manyōshū scholars and a number of existing translations, it was possible for me to put together a translation of the song that I’m happy with, although whether it is correct or not is certainly debatable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every day, every night,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;even if the moon does not shine,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;the thrush cries in sadness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I turned and looked back,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;but the flowers had already scattered;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;all consolation disappeared from my heart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The gods leave to gather in the new world&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As night turns into day, the thrush cries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Although in this living world&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;we ourselves become sad,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;at least may our dreams never vanish!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;the blossoms beseech the gods, as they resentfully fall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“even if the moon does not shine”: this is my interpretation of とも.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“As night turns into day, the thrush cries”: this is a literal quote from the Wedding Song from Ghost in the Shell.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“all consolation disappeared from my heart”: this is a bit free, more literally would be “my comforted heart vanishes irrevocably”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“does not shine” and “never vanish”: 照らず and 消ぬ are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kokugobunpou.com/%E5%8A%A9%E5%8B%95%E8%A9%9E/%E3%81%AA%E3%81%84-%E3%81%AC-%E3%82%93/&quot;&gt;archaic grammar constructions still in current use (&lt;em&gt;-zu&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;-nu&lt;/em&gt; endings)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“the blossoms beseech the gods”: the verb used is &lt;em&gt;kohinomu&lt;/em&gt; (to pray), and  &lt;a href=&quot;http://k-amc.kokugakuin.ac.jp/DM/detail.do?class_name=col_dsg&amp;amp;data_id=68283&quot;&gt;as this scholar explains &lt;/a&gt;, it means “to earnestly pray to the gods (for happiness)”. So “beseech” seems more apt than just “pray”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
